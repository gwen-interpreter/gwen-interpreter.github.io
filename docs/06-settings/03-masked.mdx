# Masked Settings

It is a common security practice to never log sensitive data. To support this practice, Gwen will hide all [settings](/docs/settings/overview) that you flag as "masked" by logging their values as `●●●●●` in all logs, reports, error messages and console outputs.

## Flagging masked settings

To flag a setting as masked, append `:masked` to its defined name.

For example, to mask a custom property named `user.password`, define it as follows in your settings file:

<Tabs
  groupId="config"
  defaultValue="properties"
  values={[
    {label: 'gwen.properties', value: 'properties'}
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="properties">

  ```properties
    user.password\:masked = secret
  ```

  *Note*: You will need to escape `:` as `\:` in properties files

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

Alternatively, you can pass a masked setting directly to the [Gwen CLI](/docs/cli/launcher) as a system property if you don't wish to store it in a file:

```shell
-Duser.password:masked=secret
```

## Using masked settings

To use a masked setting, just reference it anywhere you need to using it's name (excluding the `:masked` suffix).

Example:

```gherkin
  When I enter "${user.password}" in the password field
```

When evaluated, the above will be logged as follows in all outputs:

```gherkin
  When I enter "●●●●●" in the password field
```

:::caution

It is your resposibility to enter sensitive data such as passwords into password protected fields to prevent them from being displayed in the browser.

## Custom mask character

You can change the default mask character from `●` to another character of your choice by assigning it to the [`gwen.mask.char`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-mask-char) setting.

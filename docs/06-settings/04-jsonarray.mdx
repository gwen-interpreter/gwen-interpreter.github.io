# JSONArray Notation

> Since [v3.53.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.53.0)

Lists can be stored in settings in various ways. For example, a list of values could be stored in your settings file as follows:

<Tabs
    groupId="settings"
    defaultValue="conf"
    values={[
      {label: '.conf', value: 'conf'},
      {label: '.json', value: 'json'},
      {label: '.properties', value: 'properties'}
    ]}>

  <TabItem value="conf">

  ```json
    my {
      values = [
        "Gwen", 
        "Jenkins", 
        "Yarn", 
        "Docker"
      ]
    }
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="json">

  ```json
    {
      "my": {
        "values": [ 
          "Gwen", 
          "Jenkins", 
          "Yarn", 
          "Docker"
        ]
      }
    }
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="properties">

  ```properties
    my.values = Gwen,Jenkins,Yarn,Docker
  ```

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

To access a list of values configured in your settings as a JSON array, append `:JSONArray` to its setting name in the placeholder references in your feature or [meta](/docs/meta) steps. A JSON array literal containing the values will then be expanded inline.

<p><b>Example 1</b></p>

The following will bind the JSON Array `["Gwen","Jenkins","Yarn","Docker"]` to the `values` variable in the current scope:
```gherkin
  Given values is "${my.values:JSONArray}"
```

Will expand to:

```gherkin
  Given values is "["Gwen","Jenkins","Yarn","Docker"]"
```

<p><b>Example 2</b></p>

The following will inline the JSON Array into a JavaScript expression to get the length and store that in the `length` variable in the current scope:
```gherkin
  Given length is defined by js "${my.values:JSONArray}.length"
   Then length should be "4"
```

Will expand to:
```gherkin
  Given length is defined by js "["Gwen","Jenkins","Yarn","Docker"].length"
   Then length should be "4"
```

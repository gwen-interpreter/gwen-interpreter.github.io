The Gwen logo consists of a [Lorenz attractor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) that looks like a butterfly.

Gwen evaluates software applications by mapping [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) steps to instructions that:


- Create context (_Givens_)
- Perform actions (_Whens_)
- And check outcomes (_Thens_)

The cumulative result is a chain of instructions that execute in sequence to model cause and effect. If a small change to the application or its environment leads to a break in the chain, then Gwen will have observed the [butterfly effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). The proposition being that Gwen can detect chaotic behaviour in software.

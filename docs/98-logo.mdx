The Gwen logo consists of a [Lorenz attractor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) which looks like a butterfly and is one of Chaos theory's iconic images.

Dynamic systems can be observed to possess chaotic behavior and this is common in software. The smallest of changes to programs and environments can give rise to the most erratic effects. Gwen evaluates software systems by mapping [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) steps to instructions that:


- Create context (_Givens_)
- Perform actions (_Whens_)
- Check outcomes (_Thens_)

The cumulative result is a chain of instructions that execute in sequence to model cause and effect.  

We wanted to capture the essence of this in our logo.

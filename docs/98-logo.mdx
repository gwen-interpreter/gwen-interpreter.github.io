The Gwen logo is a [Lorenz attractor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) and is one of Chaos theory's most iconic images.

Dynamic systems can be observed to possess chaotic behavior and this is common in software. The smallest of changes to programs and environments can give rise to the most erratic effects. Gwen evaluates software systems by mapping [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) steps to executable instructions that:


- Create context (_Givens_)
- Perform actions (_Whens_)
- Assert outcomes (_Thens_)

The cumulative result is a chain of instructions running in sequence to model cause and effect.

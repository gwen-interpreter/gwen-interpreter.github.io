# About the Logo

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/gwen-logo.png')} width="330vh" className="logo"/>

The Gwen logo is a [Lorenz attractor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) that looks like 
a butterfly.

```gherkin
Feature: Deterministic chaos
    
  Scenario: The butterfly effect
    Given a deterministic and nonlinear system
     When a small change is initially applied
     Then a large change will eventually result
```

Gwen evaluates software systems and automates robotic processes by:

- Creating contexts (*Givens*)
- Performing actions (*Whens*)
- Verifying outcomes (*Thens*)

The cumulative result is a chain of instructions that execute to model cause and effect.

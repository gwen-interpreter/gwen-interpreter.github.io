# Running Gwen on LambdaTest HyperExecute

The [HyperExecute](https://www.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) grid by LambdaTest can remotely execute your Gwen features across combinations of platforms, browsers, and devices at near local speeds using customisable execution strategies. Follow the instructions here to get your Gwen features running on HyperExecute.

### Settings file

Create a new `LT.conf` settings file in your `browsers` directory as shown.

```shell {4}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── /gwen
     └── /browsers
         └──LT.conf             # Lambdatest settings file
```

Add the following content

```json
gwen {
  web {
    capability {
      "LT:Options" {
          video = true
      }
    }
    remote {
      url = "https://${env.LT_USERNAME}:${env.LT_ACCESS_KEY}@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"
    }
  }
}
```

You can enable more [LambdaTest capabilities](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/selenium-automation-capabilities/#desired-capabilities-in-selenium-4) in the `LT:Options` block if you wish. This example just enables video.

## HyperExecute YAML

Next, create a `LT-HyperExecute.yml` file in the `gwen` directory of your project. 

```shell {4}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── /gwen
     └── LT-HyperExecute.yml    # HyperExecute YAML file
```

Add the following content to execute all your Gwen features across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers on Linux using 10 parallel sessions.

```yaml {20,21,26,28}
version: 0.1

globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90

autosplit: true
parallelism: 10
concurrency: 10

runson: ${matrix.os}

pre:
  - yarn install

cacheDirectories:
  - node_modules

matrix:
  os: [linux]
  browser: ["chrome", "edge", "firefox"]

testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: dynamic
  command: find gwen/features -type f -name "*.feature"

testRunnerCommand: yarn gwen -b -c gwen/browsers/LT.conf,gwen/browsers/$browser.conf $test

uploadArtefacts:
  - name: Gwen-Report
    path:
      - gwen/output/reports/html/**

```

The `testDiscovery` element locates every feature file in the `gwen/features` directory and the `matrix` element automatically distributes and executes each of those in parallel across all the combinations of OS and browsers configured. Each browser and each feature file is passed to Gwen as `$browser` and `$test` respectively. More information about the [YAML here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml).

## Browser specific capabilities

If you want to configure browser specific [capabilities](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-web-capability-entry), you can do so in the respective `.conf` files in your `gwen/browsers` directory:

```shell {4}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── /gwen
     └── /browsers
         ├──chrome.conf
         ├──edge.conf
         └──firefox.conf
```

## Launch

[Download the HyperExecute binary](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) for your platform to the root of your project.

```shell {2}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── hyperexecute               # HyperExecute binary
 ```

Create a HyperExecute ignore file to prevent unwanted files from being uploaded to the grid

```shell {2}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── .hyperexecuteignore        # HyperExecute ingore file
 ```

Add the following content to prevent the binary and Gwen output directory from being uploaded
```
hyperexecute
gwen/output
```

Then run the following command in the root of your project to execute on the HyperExecute grid.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./hyperexecute \
  --config gwen/LT-HyperExecute.yml \
  --download-artifacts \
  --download-artifacts-path gwen/output/lt-artefacts \
  --force-clean-artifacts
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```shell
hyperexecute ^
  --config gwen\LT-HyperExecute.yml ^
  --download-artifacts ^
  --download-artifacts-path gwen\output\lt-artefacts ^
  --force-clean-artifacts
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Open the [HyperExecute dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/) to view your executions.

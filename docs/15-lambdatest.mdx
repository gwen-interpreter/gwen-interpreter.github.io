# Running Gwen on LambdaTest HyperExecute

The [HyperExecute](https://www.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) grid by LambdaTest can remotely execute your Gwen features across combinations of platforms, browsers, and devices at near local speeds using customisable execution strategies. Follow the instructions here to get your Gwen features running on HyperExecute.

### Settings file

Create a new `lambdatest.conf` settings file in your `browsers` directory as shown.

```shell {4}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── /gwen
     └── /browsers
         └── lambdatest.conf    # LambdaTest settings file
```

Add the following content

```json
gwen {
  web {
    capability {
      "LT:Options" {
          video = true
      }
    }
    remote {
      url = "https://${env.LT_USERNAME}:${env.LT_ACCESS_KEY}@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"
    }
  }
}
```

You can enable more [LambdaTest capabilities](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/selenium-automation-capabilities/#desired-capabilities-in-selenium-4) in the `LT:Options` block if you wish. This example just enables video.

## HyperExecute YAML

Next, create a `hyper-execute.yml` file in the `gwen` directory of your project. 

```shell {4}
./project                     # Your project root
 └── /gwen
     └── hyper-execute.yml    # HyperExecute YAML file
```

Add the following content to execute all your Gwen features across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers on Linux using 10 parallel sessions.

```yaml {20,21,26,28}
version: 0.1

globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90

autosplit: true
parallelism: 10
concurrency: 10

runson: ${matrix.os}

pre:
  - yarn install

cacheDirectories:
  - node_modules

matrix:
  os: [linux]
  browser: ["chrome", "edge", "firefox"]

testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: dynamic
  command: find gwen/features -type f -name "*.feature"

testRunnerCommand: yarn gwen -b -c gwen/browsers/lambdatest.conf,gwen/browsers/$browser.conf $test

```

The `testDiscovery` element locates every feature file in the `gwen/features` directory and the `matrix` element automatically distributes and executes each of those in parallel across all the combinations of OS and browsers configured. Each browser and each feature file is passed to Gwen as `$browser` and `$test` respectively.

> If you want to run the Gwen samples instead, replace `gwen/features` with `gwen/samples` in the `testDiscovery command`.

More information about the [HyperExecute YAML here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml).

## Browser specific capabilities

If you want to configure browser specific [capabilities](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-web-capability-entry), you can do so in the respective `.conf` files in your `gwen/browsers` directory:

```shell {4}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── /gwen
     └── /browsers
         ├──chrome.conf
         ├──edge.conf
         └──firefox.conf
```

## Package JSON script

Create a new `gwen:hyperExecute` script in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file in your project to invoke the [HyperExecute CLI](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) and launch on the grid.

```shell {2}
./project             # Your project root
 └── package.json     # Package json file
```

```json {2}
"scripts": {
  "gwen:hyperExecute": "./hyperexecute --config gwen/hyper-execute.yml"
}
```

## Launch

[Download the HyperExecute binary](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) for your platform to the root of your project.

```shell {2}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── hyperexecute               # HyperExecute binary
 ```

Create a `.hyperexecuteignore` file in the root of your project.

```shell {2}
./project                       # Your project root
 └── .hyperexecuteignore        # HyperExecute ignore file
 ```

Add the following content to the ignore file to prevent the binary and the Gwen output directory from being uploaded
```
hyperexecute
gwen/output
```

Set the following enviornment variables on your system to your LambdaTest username and access key:
- LT_USERNAME
- LT_ACCESS_KEY


Then call the `gwen:hyperExecute` script in your project to launch your Gwen features on the HyperExecute grid

# Profiles

> Since [v4.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

You can configure one or many launch profiles, each with its own options and [settings](/docs/settings). This enables you to configure unique launch configurations for each process in your project so you don't have to manage them externally. You simply give each profile a name and define its configuration in a same named settings file in the `gwen/conf/profiles` folder of your project. Then when you're ready to launch, you specify the name of the profile you want to run with the [`-p|--profile`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-profile) option.

## Profile Settings

### Example

Say you have two processes in your project that need to be launched differently, and you want:

<ul>
  <li>
   `process1` to:
    <ul>
      <li>Call the `gwen/features/process1.feature` only</li>
      <li>Pass in the `gwen/input/data-feed.csv` data feed file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  `process2` to:
    <ul>
      <li>Call the `gwen/features/process2.feature` only</li>
      <li>Not pass in any data feed</li>
    </ul>
</ul>


The first step in configuring these is to create the `process1.conf` and `process2.conf` files in the `gwen/conf/profiles` folder as shown:

> The names of the settings files (minus their extensions) will serve as the names of the profiles

```shell {10,11}
  ./                              # Project root
   ├── gwen.conf                  # Common settings
   └── /gwen
       ├── /conf
       │   ├── /browsers          # Browser settings
       │   |   └── ..
       │   ├──/env                # Environment settings
       │   |  └── ..
       │   └──/profiles           # Launch profile settings
       │      ├── process1.conf
       │      └── process2.conf
       ├── /features              # Features (and associative meta)
       │   ├── process1.feature
       │   ├── process1.meta
       │   ├── process2.feature
       │   └── process2.meta
       ├── /input                 # Input data
       │   └── data-feed.csv
       └── /meta                  # Meta
           ..
```

#### process1.conf

<ul>
  <li>Call the `gwen/features/process1.feature` only</li>
  <li>Pass in the `gwen/input/data-feed.csv` data feed file</li>
</ul>

*File: gwen/conf/profiles/process1.conf*
```json
gwen {
  launch {
    options {
      features = [
        "${gwen.baseDir}/features/process1.feature"
      ]
      inputData = "${gwen.baseDir}/input/data-feed.csv"
    }
  }
}
```

#### process2.conf

<ul>
  <li>Call the `gwen/features/process2.feature` only</li>
  <li>Don't pass in any data feed</li>
</ul>

*File: gwen/conf/profiles/process2.conf*
```json
gwen {
  launch {
    options {
      features = [
        "${gwen.baseDir}/features/process2.feature"
      ]
      inputData = ""
    }
  }
}
```

## Launching Profiles

  To launch a profile, simply pass the profile settings file name (minus the path and extension) to the [`-p|--profile`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-profile) launcher option. Gwen will find and load the same named settings file in the `gwen/conf/profiles` directory and launch that profile for you.

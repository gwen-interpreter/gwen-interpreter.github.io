# Locator Level Timeouts

> Since [v2.19.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.19.0)

Gwen supports specifying [locator](/docs/dsl#element-locators) level timeouts for overriding the default timeout [`gwen.web.locator.wait.seconds`](/docs/settings#gwen-web-locator-wait-seconds). This is useful for cases where you may want to increase the locator timeout period for some web elements without impacting others. A web element that takes a long time to load for example can have a higher locator timeout  without slowing down the rest of your locators.

### Timeout Annotations

> Since [v2.73.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.73.0)

Syntax

```gherkin
@Timeout('<duration>')
```

Where:
- `<duration>` can be any of:
  - `#h#m#s#ms` for a number of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('1h2m30s100ms')`
  - `#h#m#s` for a number of hours, minutes and seconds - example: `@Timeout('1h2m30s')`
  - `#h#m#ms` for a number of hours, minutes and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('1h2m100ms')`
  - `#h#ms` for a number of hours and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('1h100ms')`
  - `#h` for a number of hours - example: `@Timeout('1h')`
  - `#m#s#ms` for a number of minutes, seconds and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('2m30s100ms')`
  - `#m#s` for a number of minutes and seconds - example: `@Timeout('2m30s')`
  - `#m#ms` for a number of minutes and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('2m100ms')`
  - `#m` for a number of minutes - example: `@Timeout('2m')`
  - `#s#ms` for a number of seconds and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('30s100ms')`
  - `#s` for a number of seconds - example: `@Timeout('30s')`
  - `#ms` for a number of milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('100ms')`
  - `0h` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0h')`
  - `0m` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0m')`
  - `0s` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0s')`
  - `0ms` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0ms')`

The timeout annotation can be used used on various [wait](/docs/dsl#sleeps-and-waits), [until/while](/docs/dsl#untilwhile), [for each](/docs/dsl#foreach), [assertion](/docs/dsl#assertions) or [locator](/docs/dsl#element-locators) steps.

> #### Delay Annotation
> The same duration patterns also apply to `@Delay` annotations used to control the delay time between repeated operations in the various [wait](/docs/dsl#sleeps-and-waits), [until/while](/docs/dsl#untilwhile) loops. 

#### Examples

```gherkin
  # will cause lookup to fail immediately if username is not present on the page
  And @Timeout('0s') the username can be located by id "username"

  # will cause lookup to fail if the username is not available on the page after waiting 20 seconds
  And @Timeout('20s') the username can be located by id "username"

  # will cause lookup to fail if the username is not available on the page after waiting 1 minute and 30 seconds
  And @Timeout('1m30s') the username can be located by id "username"

```

### DSL Approach

:::caution Deprecated
  Deprecated since v3.73.0 and will be dropped in next major Gwen 4 release. 
  <p>Instead use above annotation approach.</p>
  :::

```gherkin
  # will cause lookup to fail immediately if username is not present on the page
  And the username can be located by id "username" with no wait

  # will cause lookup to fail if the username is not available on the page after waiting 20 seconds
  And the username can be located by id "username" with 20 second timeout

```

## DSLs

The following DSLs support locator timeouts:

  - [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression)
  - [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>" with no <wait|timeout>`](/docs/dsl#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression-with-no-timeout)
  - [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>" with <timeoutSecs> second <wait|timeout>`](/docs/dsl#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression-with-timeout)
  - [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>" at index <index> with no <wait|timeout>`](/docs/dsl#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression-at-index-with-no-timeout)
  - [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>" at index <index> in <otherElement> with no <wait|timeout>`](/docs/dsl#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression-at-index-in-other-element-with-no-timeout)
  - [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>" at index <index> in <otherElement>  with <timeoutSecs> second <wait|timeout>`](/docs/dsl#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression-at-index-in-other-element-with-timeout)

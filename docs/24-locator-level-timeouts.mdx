# Locator Level Timeouts

> Since [v2.19.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.19.0)

Gwen supports specifying [locator](/docs/dsl#element-locators) level timeouts for overriding the default timeout [`gwen.web.locator.wait.seconds`](/docs/settings#gwen-web-locator-wait-seconds). This is useful for cases where you may want to increase the locator timeout period for some web elements without impacting others. A web element that takes a long time to load for example can have a higher locator timeout  without slowing down the rest of your locators.

### Timeout Annotations

> Since [v2.73.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.73.0)

Syntax

```gherkin
@Timeout('<duration>')
```

Where:
- `<duration>` can be any of:
  - `#h#m#s#ms` for a number of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('1h2m30s100ms')`
  - `#h#m#s` for a number of hours, minutes and seconds - example: `@Timeout('1h2m30s')`
  - `#h#m#ms` for a number of hours, minutes and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('1h2m100ms')`
  - `#h#ms` for a number of hours and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('1h100ms')`
  - `#h` for a number of hours - example: `@Timeout('1h')`
  - `#m#s#ms` for a number of minutes, seconds and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('2m30s100ms')`
  - `#m#s` for a number of minutes and seconds - example: `@Timeout('2m30s')`
  - `#m#ms` for a number of minutes and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('2m100ms')`
  - `#m` for a number of minutes - example: `@Timeout('2m')`
  - `#s#ms` for a number of seconds and milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('30s100ms')`
  - `#s` for a number of seconds - example: `@Timeout('30s')`
  - `#ms` for a number of milliseconds - example: `@Timeout('100ms')`
  - `0h` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0h')`
  - `0m` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0m')`
  - `0s` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0s')`
  - `0ms` for no timeout period - example: `@Timeout('0ms')`

The timeout annotation can be used used on various [wait](/docs/dsl#sleeps-and-waits), [until/while](/docs/dsl#untilwhile), [for each](/docs/dsl#foreach), [assertion](/docs/dsl#assertions) or [locator](/docs/dsl#element-locators) steps.

> #### Delay Annotation
> The same duration patterns also apply to `@Delay` annotations used to control the delay time between repeated operations in the various [wait](/docs/dsl#sleeps-and-waits), [until/while](/docs/dsl#untilwhile) loops. 

#### Examples

```gherkin
  # will cause lookup to fail immediately if username is not present on the page
  And @Timeout('0s') the username can be located by id "username"

  # will cause lookup to fail if the username is not available on the page after waiting 20 seconds
  And @Timeout('20s') the username can be located by id "username"

  # will cause lookup to fail if the username is not available on the page after waiting 1 minute and 30 seconds
  And @Timeout('1m30s') the username can be located by id "username"

```

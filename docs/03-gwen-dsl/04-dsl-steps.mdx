# DSL Steps

## Readily executable Gherkin steps

Every step in your meta or feature specs that matches a [supported DSL](#supported-dsl) expression is considered a DSL step and as such is readily executable by Gwen.

:::note Example

The following is a DSL Step:

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
```

Since it matches the supported DSL expression:

- [`the page title <should|should not> <be|contain|start with|end with|match regex|match xpath|match template|match template file> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#the-page-title-shouldshould-not-becontainstart-withend-withmatch-regexmatch-xpathmatch-templatematch-template-file-expression)

:::

## All execution happens in the DSL

Every step interpreted by Gwen will directly or inderectly through StepDefs result in either:
- one or many DSL steps that will execute 
- or undefined steps that will not execute

:::note Step execution rules

Every Gherkin step is interpreted for execution using three general rules. 

1. StepDef rule
   - If the step is bound to a StepDef then reapply these rules to every step in the body of that StepDef
2. DSL rule
   - If the step is a DSL step then execute it using the DSL code in the embedded automation engine
3. Undefined rule
   - If neither of the above rules are satisfied then report an undefined step error
   
:::

StepDefs can override DSL steps. If a StepDef calls itself then a matching DSL step (if one exists) will be called, otherwise a recursion error will be reported.

## DSL Usage

Use DSL steps to compose StepDefs in meta to make your feature steps executable. 

For example, the following StepDef..

:::note StepDef
```gherkin {4-7}
  @Context
  @StepDef
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
       When I navigate to "${todo.page.url}"
       Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
        And my todo list should be hidden
```

..calls out to 4 DSL steps:

..to execute this feature step:

:::note Feature Step
```gherkin
  Given a new todo list
```
:::

:::caution Avoid using DSL steps in feature specs
Although you can use DSL steps directly in your feature specs, we do not recommend you write "DSL aware" features. That's what meta is for!
:::

:::info Coming to Gwen 3
We are planning to ban DSL steps from feature specs by default in the upcomming Gwen 3 release by defaulting the [`gwen.feature.mode`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings#gwenfeaturemode) setting to `declarative` instead of `imperative`.

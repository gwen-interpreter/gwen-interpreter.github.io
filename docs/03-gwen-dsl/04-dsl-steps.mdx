# DSL Steps

## Readily executable Gherkin steps

DSL steps are readily executable by Gwen. Any step in your meta or feature specs that matches a [supported DSL](#supported-dsl) expression is considered a DSL step.

:::note Example

The following is a DSL Step:

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
```

Since it matches the supported DSL expression:

- [`the page title <should|should not> <be|contain|start with|end with|match regex|match xpath|match template|match template file> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#the-page-title-shouldshould-not-becontainstart-withend-withmatch-regexmatch-xpathmatch-templatematch-template-file-expression)

:::

## All execution happens in the DSL

Every step interpreted by Gwen will directly or inderectly through StepDefs result in either:
- one or many DSL steps being executed
- one or many undefined steps not being executed
- or any combination of the above

:::note Step execution rules

Gwen interprets steps for execution according to the following rules:

1. StepDef rule
   - If the step is bound to a StepDef then reapply these rules to every step in the body of that StepDef
2. DSL rule
   - If the step is a DSL step then execute it using the DSL code in the embedded automation engine
3. Undefined rule
   - If neither of the above rules are satisfied then report an undefined step error
   
:::

StepDefs can override DSL steps and make calls to overriden steps. If a StepDef calls itself however, a preventative infinite recursion error will be reported.

In the ideal case, all steps will execute. It is your job as a Gwen user to define StepDefs for all non DSL steps in your features (and in your meta if you introduce any there). Gwen will help you by reporting any such steps you may miss as being undefined. Of course, syntax and other errors may occur and Gwen will report those also.

## Use DSL steps in meta

:::caution Avoid using DSL steps in features
Although you can use DSL steps directly in your feature specs, we do not recommend you write "DSL aware" features. That's what meta is for!
:::

Use DSL steps to compose StepDefs in meta to make your feature steps executable. 

For example, to make this step in your feature executable:

:::note Feature Step
```gherkin
  Given a new todo list
```
:::

..you could compose this StepDef in your meta:

:::note StepDef
```gherkin {4-7}
  @Context
  @StepDef
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
       When I navigate to "https://todomvc.com/examples/react"
       Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
        And my todo list should not be displayed
```
:::

:::info Coming to Gwen 3
We are planning to ban DSL steps from feature specs by default in the upcomming Gwen 3 release by defaulting the [`gwen.feature.mode`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings#gwenfeaturemode) setting to `declarative` instead of `imperative`.

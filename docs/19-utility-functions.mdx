# Utility Functions

> Since [v3.56.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.56.0)

##  Date formatter

If a field on screen provides a date in a specific format, you can convert it to a different format using the date format utility.

> For supported date and time patterns, see [SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html)

### Example

```gherkin {2}
  Given iso date can be located by css ".date"
    And dmy date is "${ (date = iso date) :=> date.from('yyyy-MM-dd').to('dd/MM/yyyy') }"
```

##  Element selector

If you define a selector for a parent element, you can locate the child relative to the parent by reusing the parent.

### Example

```gherkin {2}
  Given nav can be located by js "document.getElementsByClassName('navbar__items')[1]"
    And nav item can be located by js "${ (elem = nav) :=> elem.selector }.children[0]"
```

##  Element state checker

Capture a boolean `true` or `false` denoting whether or not an element is displayed, hidden, checked, ticked, unchecked, unticked, enabled, or disabled.

### Example

```gherkin {2}
  Given nav can be located by js "document.getElementsByClassName('navbar__items')[1]"
    And nav visible is "${ (elem = nav) :=> elem.displayed }"
```

##  Element attribute getter

Capture the value of any attribute on an element.

### Example

```gherkin {2}
  Given the date field can be located by css ".data"
    And the date field type is "${ (elem = the data field) :=> elem.attr('type') }"
```

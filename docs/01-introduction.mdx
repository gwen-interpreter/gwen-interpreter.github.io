# Introduction

## Gwen

Gwen is a [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) interpreter for driving automation with feature specifications.

Automation is achieved through Gherkin bindings called [meta specs](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Meta-Features) which you compose with the [Gwen DSL](gwen-dsl/dsl-steps) and maintain alongside your feature files. An embedded web engine executes each step in your features according to those bindings to automate operations in browsers for you. Your features remain unchanged and execute when Gwen is launched and the meta is bound.

### 1. Declare your feature specs

*Declare feature specs to describe how scenarios and examples must behave.*

Feature specifications are used to communicate requirements that are clear, concise and declarative. For example, the following describes how adding items to a todo list should behave.

:::note Feature Spec

*File: features/todo.feature*
```gherkin
Feature: Add todo items
 
  Scenario: Create todo list
    Given a new todo list
     When the following items are added
          | Item          |
          | Get the milk  |
          | Walk the dog  |
     Then the list will contain 2 items
```
:::

Gwen aims to take these "as is" and make them executable.

:::info Recommendation
Start by writing feature specs to describe intended behavior without giving any thought to automation or execution. Then when it makes sense to automate, compose your meta incrementally and maintain a useful suite of specifications that you can execute often.
:::

### 2. Compose your meta specs

*Compose meta specs to describe what your feature specs will execute.*

Meta specifications describe what Gwen will execute in the Gherkin language too and are maintained in separate meta files that bind to your feature files when Gwen is launched. All your step definitions and bindings required for automation are defined in meta so your high level features remain unconcerned with this detail.

The following example meta describes how the above feature spec could be used to automate a test against a running [todo application](https://todomvc.com/examples/react).

:::note Meta Spec

*File: features/todo.meta*
```gherkin
Feature: Todo Meta


  @Context
  @StepDef
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
       When I navigate to "${todo.page.url}"
       Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
        And my todo list should be hidden

  @Action
  @StepDef
  @DataTable(header="top")
  @ForEach
  Scenario: the following items are added
      Given the todo field can be located by class "new-todo"
        And my new item is "${data[Item]}"
       When I enter my new item in the todo field
       Then my todo list should contain my new item

  @Assertion
  @StepDef
  Scenario: the list will contain <expected-count> items
      Given the displayed count can be located by css ".todo-count strong"
       Then the displayed count should be "$<expected-count>"
```
:::

#### Declaring step definitions

Each step definition is declared as a `@StepDef` annotated scenario with a name that matches that of the step in the feature it binds to. Each one calls out to one or more [DSL steps](gwen-dsl/dsl-steps) (or potentially other StepDefs) to perform the specified operations at run time.

The first StepDef in our meta example binds to the first step in the feature and will only execute when it is interpreted for execution by Gwen.

:::note Feature Step 1
```gherkin
  Given a new todo list
```
:::
:::note StepDef 1
```gherkin {2-3}
  @Context
  @StepDef
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
       When I navigate to "${todo.page.url}"
       Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
        And my todo list should be hidden
```
:::

#### Web elements selectors

The first thing the above will do is bind the selector for locating the todo list element on the web page to the name `my todo list`. Later steps can then reference that element using this name to interact with it and Gwen will locate it dynamically.

:::note StepDef 1, Step 1

```gherkin
  Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
```

Calls DSL step:

- [`<element> can be located by <id|name|tag name|tag|css selector|css|xpath|class name|class|link text|partial link text|javascript|js> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#element-can-be-located-by-idnametag-nametagcss-selectorcssxpathclass-nameclasslink-textpartial-link-textjavascriptjs-expression)

:::

#### Navigating to a web page

The next step in this StepDef will open a new browser window and navigate to the URL in the `todo.page.url` property.

:::note StepDef 1, Step 2

```gherkin
  When I navigate to "${todo.page.url}"
```

Calls DSL step:

- [`I navigate to "<url>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#i-navigate-to-url)

:::

#### Accessing externalised properties

We could have just hard coded the https://todomvc.com/examples/react URL in the above step, but externalising it enables us to target different environments without changing our meta. This is useful during development when you want to execute against a locally running instance of the application or during testing when it is running on a different host or port. With this approach you can define a [settings](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings) file per environment and assign the URL for that environment to the `todo.page.url` property in each file. Then when you want to target an envionment, you pass the settings file for that environment to Gwen and the URL will be resolved accordingly.

:::note Properties
*File: env/test.properties*
```properties
  # test instance url
  todo.page.url = https://todomvc.com/examples/react
```
:::

#### Checking the page title

The next step in the same StepDef checks that the page title in the browser window contains the string literal "TodoMVC" in it. If it doesn't then an assertion error will be raised, otherwise execution will resume to the next step. It is generally a good idea when navigating to a page to verify that you did indeed land on that page before proceeding to interact with it. Checking the title is one way to do it which will suffice in this case.

:::note StepDef 1, Step 3

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
```

Calls DSL step:

- [`the page title <should|should not> <be|contain|start with|end with|match regex|match xpath|match template|match template file> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#the-page-title-shouldshould-not-becontainstart-withend-withmatch-regexmatch-xpathmatch-templatematch-template-file-expression)

:::

#### Verifying that an element is hidden from view

The last step in this StepDef verifies that the web element containing the current list of todo items is hidden from view. We expect it to not be displayed because we haven't added any items to it yet. Recall that we bound this element in the first step earlier to the name `my todo list`. So here we reference it by that name and if Gwen cannot see it on the page then execution will resume, otherwise an assertion error will be raised. 

:::note StepDef 1, Steps 4

```gherkin
  And my todo list should be hidden
```

Calls DSL step:

- [`<element> <should|should not> be <displayed|hidden|checked|ticked|unchecked|unticked|enabled|disabled>`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#element-shouldshould-not-be-displayedhiddencheckedtickeduncheckeduntickedenableddisabled)

:::

#### Processing records in data tables

The second StepDef specifies the `@DataTable` and `@ForEach` annotations which work together to process each record of data in the table of the second step in the feature.

:::note Feature Step 2
```gherkin
  When the following items are added
       | Item          |
       | Get the milk  |
       | Walk the dog  |
```
:::
:::note StepDef 2
```gherkin {2-5}
  @Action
  @StepDef
  @DataTable(header="top")
  @ForEach
  Scenario: the following items are added
      Given the todo field can be located by class "new-todo"
        And my new item is "${data[Item]}"
       When I enter my new item in the todo field
       Then my todo list should contain my new item
:::

The `header="top"` attribute in the `@DataTable` annotation designates the topmost row in the table as the header record. Each name in this header will be bound to the respective data in each record as it is iterated over and made available to the steps in the body of the StepDef as `data[name]`. In this example the sole field named `Item` is referenced as `data[Item]` in the second step of the body.

:::note StepDef 2, Step 2

```gherkin
  And my new item is "${data[Item]}"
```

Calls DSL step:

- [`<attribute> <is|will be> "<value>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#attribute-iswill-be-value)

:::

This step binds the resolved value to a string named `my new item` for use by the two steps that follow. We do this to eliminate the redundancy of having to resolve it twice and also to make maintenance easier should we ever decide to rename this field in the table. These steps enter this value into the `todo field` and verify that it was succesfully added to `my todo list`. This is the same `my todo list` that we earlier confirmed was absent when we opened the page in the browser. We reuse it here to check that it contains our newly added item (for the current record iteration). If it does not, then an assertion error will be raised. 

:::note StepDef 2, Steps 3 and 4

```gherkin
  When I enter my new item in the todo field
  Then my todo list should contain my new item
```

Calls DSL steps:

- [`I <enter|type> <attribute> in <element>`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#i-entertype-attribute-in-element)
- [`<element|attribute> <should|should not> <be|contain|start with|end with|match regex|match xpath> <attribute>`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#elementattribute-shouldshould-not-becontainstart-withend-withmatch-regexmatch-xpath-attribute)

:::

#### Passing parameters to StepDefs

The last StepDef accepts the number of expected items from the last step in the feature into a parameter placeholder named `expected-count` and then uses that to assert its value against `the displayed count` on the page. In this example, the value 2 will passed as the parameter.

:::note Feature Step 3
```gherkin
  Then the list will contain 2 items
```
:::
:::note StepDef 3
```gherkin {2-3,5}
  @Assertion
  @StepDef
  Scenario: the list will contain <expected-count> items
      Given the displayed count can be located by css ".todo-count strong"
       Then the displayed count should be "$<expected-count>"
```
:::

#### Behavioral Semantics

The following annotations on StepDefs are used to associate behavior types and enforce the following rules if you set your [`gwen.behavior.rules`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings#gwenbehaviorrules) setting to `strict`.

:::info Coming to Gwen 3
We are planning to enable `strict` rules by default in the upcomming Gwen 3 release. The current default is `lenient` meaning that these and other rules like *Given-When-Then* order are not enforced.
:::

| StepDefs annotated with.. | can only bind steps tied to keyword.. | because..                      |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :----------------------------- |
|       `@Context `         |                 Given                 | Givens imply context behavior  |
|       `@Action`           |                 When                  | Whens imply action behavior    |
|       `@Assertion`        |                 Then                  | Thens imply assertion behavior |

\* When binding to a step declared with `And`, `But`, or `*`, then the keyword in the first step in the chain of preceeding steps declared with either `Given`, `When` or `Then` will become the tying keyword. Should the topmost step in a chain be declared with `*`, then the tying keyword will be `Given`.

For example, the following binding will be permitted since the feature step is declared with the `Then` keyword and the StepDef is annotated with `@Assertion`.

:::note Feature Step 3
```gherkin
  Then the list will contain 2 items
```
:::
:::note StepDef 3
```gherkin {1}
  @Assertion
  @StepDef
  Scenario: the list will contain <expected-count> items
      Given the displayed count can be located by css ".todo-count strong"
       Then the displayed count should be "$<expected-count>"
```
:::

If we were to change the keyword in the feature step to `When` however, it would not only read poorly but would no longer imply `@Assertion` behavior and Gwen would report the violation. Similarly, if we were to change the behavior annotation on the StepDef to `@Context`, then that behavior would not be implied by the `Then` keyword declared in the feature step.

#### Associative meta

When the [`gwen.associative.meta`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Runtime-Settings#gwenassociativemeta) setting is enabled, Gwen will automatically associate and bind all same named feature and meta files discovered in a directory with each other. In the following case, the meta would be considered associative.
```
features/todo.feature
features/todo.meta
```

:::info Coming to Gwen 3
We are planning to enable associative meta by default in the upcomming Gwen 3 release. The current default is that all meta files discovered in a directory will unconditionally bind to all features in that directory and it's subdirectories.
:::

### 3. Launch Gwen to automate

*Launch Gwen to bind your meta and execute your features to drive automation.*

The example presented in this introduction would execute to automate a test.

:::tip
Your Gwen usage need not be confined to just testing. You can automate other repetitive and robotic processes too.
:::

#### Gwen CLI

The [Gwen CLI](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Command-Line-Interface) is used to launch Gwen and execute features. When launched on a directory, it will recursively discover and bind all meta and feature files in that directory and execute all the features. Any properties passed in will be loaded and all `${prop.name}` placeholder references throughout the meta and feature files will resolve during execution.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

```
./gwen -b -p env/test.properties features
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

```
gwen -b -p env/test.properties features
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Where:
- `-b` instructs Gwen to exit immediately after execution completes (omitting it will open the [REPL](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/REPL-Console) instead)
- `-p` specifies the properties file to load
- `features` is the directory containing the associative meta and feature files to execute

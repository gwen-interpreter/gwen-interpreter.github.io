# Eager or Lazy Bindings

`@Eager` and `@Lazy` annotations can be used to control when [bindings](/docs/dsl#bindings) are evaluated. In the absence of either annotation, bindings will be evaluated every time they are referenced and discarded once used.

## @Eager

> Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.9.0">v3.9.0</Link>

The `@Eager` annotation can be used to immediately evaluate a binding. The eagerly bound value is instantly returned whenever the name is referenced.

:::note Eager example

```gherkin {1}
  Given @Eager time is defined by js "new Date().getTime()"
   When I capture time as time 1
    And I capture time as time 2 
   Then time 1 should be "${time 2}"
```

`time 1` and `time 2` will have the same value since `time` is evaluated and bound immediately at step 1.

## @Lazy

> Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.9.0">v3.9.0</Link>

The `@Lazy` annotation can be used to evaluate bindings when they are first referenced. The lazily bound value is returned whenever the name is referenced thereafter.

:::note Eager example

```gherkin {1,2}
  Given @Lazy time is defined by js "new Date().getTime()"
   When I capture time as time 1
    And I capture time as time 2 
   Then time 1 should be "${time 2}"
```

`time 1` and `time 2` will have the same value since `time` is bound and evaluated when it is first referenced.

## Default (ephemeral)

> Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0">v1.0.0</Link>

In the absence of either annoation, the bindings will be unconditionally evaluated every time the name is referenced without being saved to memory. This is the default behaviour.

:::note Eager example

```gherkin {2-3}
  Given time is defined by js "new Date().getTime()"
   When I capture time as time 1
    And I capture time as time 2 
   Then time 1 should not be "${time 2}"
```

`time 1` and `time 2` will have different values since `time` is evaluated, bound and discarded at steps 2 and 3.

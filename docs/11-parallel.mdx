# Parallel Execution

Gwen can execute features and scenarios in parallel threads.

## Maximum threads

The maximum number of parallel threads can be controlled through the following setting:

- [`gwen.parallel.maxThreads`](/docs/settings#gwen-parallel-maxThreads)
  - By default this is set to `auto`, meaning that one thread will execute on each available CPU core (for example: 8 threads would execute on an 8 core machine)
  - This can be set to a desired number of threads
    - When less than the number of available cores, the remaining cores will be free
    - When greater than the number of available cores, more than one thread may execute on some or all cores (use judiciously)

## Parallel feature execution

> Since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)


> Features will run in parallel if you specify:
> -  the [`--parallel`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-parallel) launch option and your [state level](/docs/settings#gwen-state-level) is set to `feature`

When [`maxThreads`](#maximum-threads) is `auto` (default)
- If you launch Gwen on an 8 core machine with the `--parallel` option passing in 8 feature files (or a single directory containing 8 feature files), then the 8 features will run in parallel across the cores. If you instead provide 9 features, then 8 of them will execute in parallel and the remaining feature execution will be deferred until one of those completes.


## Parallel scenario execution

> Since [v2.22.1](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.22.1)

> Scenarios will run in parallel if you specify:
> - the [`--parallel`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-parallel) launch option and your [state level](/docs/settings#gwen-state-level) is set to `scenario`

When [`maxThreads`](#maximum-threads) is `auto` (default)
- If you launch Gwen on a 8 core machine with the `--parallel` option passing in many feature files (or a single directory containing many feature files), then at most 8 scenarios will run in parallel across the cores at any one time. If there are a total of 9 scenarios, then 8 of them will execute in parallel and the remaining scenario execution be deferred until one of those completes.

### Parallel scenario outline examples

> Since [v3.69.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.69.0)

The `Parallel` annotation can be used on examples to force each entry to run in parallel

```gherkin {4}
  Scenario Outline: I load items from data files
    When I add a <Status> "<Item>" item
    
    @Parallel
    Examples: add item
      | Item         | Status  |
      | Walk the dog | pending |
      | Get the milk | done    |
      | Feed the cat | pending |
```

It can also be used in conjunction with `Examples` annotations

```gherkin {2}
  @Examples("data/items.csv")
  @Parallel
  Scenario Outline: I load items from data files
    When I add a <Status> "<Item>" item
```

> <p><b>Restrictions</b></p>
> The `Parallel` annotation:
>  - Cannot be used in a nested manner (an error will be raised on any such detection)
>  - Will come to effect only when Gwen is invoked without the [`--parallel`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-parallel) launch option (i.e: when no other parallel execution is taking place), and will be implicity removed otherwise.

## Staggering

> Since [v1.1.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

An optional [ramp up interval](/docs/settings#gwen-rampup-interval-seconds) can be configured to stagger parallel executions.

#### Example: 

A 5 second interval would stagger parallel feature executions like this over 4 cores:

```text
    time  00   05   10   15   seconds
          │    │    │    │
  core 1  │<── feature 1a ──>|<── feature 1b ──> ..
  core 2  │    │<── feature 2a ──>|<── feature 2b ──> ..
  core 3  │    │    │<── feature 3a ──>|<── feature 3b ──> ..
  core 4  │    │    │    │<── feature 4a ──>|<── feature 4b ──> ..
  ```

# Template Matching

> Since [v2.16.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.16.0)

Template matching allow users to compare any source content with a target template that can either be specified as a text literal or text stored in a file, and perform extract, ignore, and inject operations at the same time.

## Examples

The following examples assume that the following JSON value is bound to an attribute named `my value` in the currently available scope:
- `{"id":42,"category":{"name":"pet"},"name":"tiger","status":"available"}`

Templates can contain JSON, XML, HTML, or any type of text and can also have multiple lines. The examples below use single-line JSON only.

## Match and Ignore

The following example will successfully match `my value` and:
- Ignore the `id` value where `!{}` appears

```gherkin
  Then my value should match template
       """
       {"id":!{},"category":{"name":"pet"},"name":"tiger","status":"available"}
       """
```

## Match, Ignore, and Extract

The following example will successfully match `my value` and:
- Ignore the `id` value where `!{}` appears
- Extract the `tiger` value where `@{pet name}` appears and bind it to the attribute named `pet name` in the feature scope

```gherkin
  Then my value should match template
       """
       {"id":!{},"category":{"name":"pet"},"name":"@{pet name}","status":"available"}
       """
```

Subsequent steps can access the extracted `pet name` attribute like any other Gwen binding. For example, the following checks it's value:

```gherkin
  And pet name should be "tiger"
```

## Match, Ignore, Extract, and Inject

The following example will successfully match `my value` and:
- Ignore the `id` value where `!{}` appears
- Extract the `tiger` value where `@{pet name}` appears and bind it to the attribute named `pet name` in the feature scope
- Inject the value bound to the `my status` attribute into the template where `${my status}` appears.

```gherkin
  Given my status is "available"
   Then my value should match template
        """
        {"id":!{},"category":{"name":"pet"},"name":"@{pet name}","status":"${my status}"}
        """
    And pet name should be "tiger"
```

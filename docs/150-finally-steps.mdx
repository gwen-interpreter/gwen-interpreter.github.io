# Finally Steps

> Since [v3.3.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

## @Finally

The `@Finally` annotation can be used to define steps that should always execute regardless of the current execution status. For example, a step that could potentially be skipped due to an earier step failing can be instructed to execute unconditionally with this annotation.

Consider the following example.

:::note Finally example

```gherkin {5}
  Scenario: Onboard a new user
    Given I am logged in as administator
     When I register a new user
     Then the new user should be able to login
      And @Finally I log out as administrator
```

The last step in this example is annotated with `@Finally` and will therefore always execute

:::

If any of the preceeding steps (1 to 3) in this example fail or are skipped for whatever reason, then the last step will still execute!

:::note

Only the last step in a parent node (Background, Scenario, Outline, or `StepDef`) can have this annotation.

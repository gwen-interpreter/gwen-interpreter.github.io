# String Interpolation

> Since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

String interpolation is often useful to reference settings, captured values and other text throughout your feature and meta files. To support this, Gwen provides a placholder substitution mechanism.

## Placeholder Syntax

Placeholders are declared using the `${placholder}` syntax and can include:

- An environment variable name (since gwen-web 2.36.0)
  - example: `${env.USER}` for the `USER` variable
- A system property name
- A [Gwen setting](/docs/settings) name
- A named binding in the currently accessible scope
- [JS arrow functions](/docs/js-functions#inlined-functions)
 
### Examples

Substitution involves replacing named placeholders with their values.

```gherkin
 Feature: String Interpolation

Scenario: By Substitution
    
    Given my mechanism is "substitution"
      And my value is "${my.property}"
      And my proposition is "By ${my mechanism}, my value will be ${my value}"
     Then my proposition should be "By substitution, my value will be ${my.property}"
```

## Elvis Operator

> Since [v4.4.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v4.4.0)

The elvis `?:` syntax can be used to define default values for references which may not exist

### Examples

```gherkin
 Given a is "${some.string :? 'default'}"
   And b is "${some.string :? '${some.other.string}'}"
   And c is "${some.string :? blank}"
   And d is "${some.boolean :? false}"
   And e is "${some.string1 :? '${some.string2 ?: blank}'}"
```

- Set `a` to value bound to `some.string` or to `default` string value if undefined
- Set `b` to value bound to `some.string` or to value bound to `some.other.string` if undefined
- Set `c` to value bound to `some.string` or to a blank string value if undefined:
- Set `d` to value bound to `some.string` or to a false Boolean value if undefined:
- Set `e` to value bound to `some.string1` or value bound to `some.string2` if undefined, or to a blank string value if both are undefined:

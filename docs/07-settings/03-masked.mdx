# Masked Settings

> Since [v2.48.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.48.0)

It is a common security practice to never log sensitive data. To support this practice, Gwen will hide all [settings](/docs/settings/reference) that you flag as "masked" by logging their values as `*****` in all logs, reports, error messages and console outputs.

## Flagging masked settings

To flag a setting as masked, append `:masked` to its defined name.

For example, to mask a custom property named `user.password`, define it as follows in your settings file:

<Tabs
    groupId="settings"
    defaultValue="conf"
    values={[
      {label: '.conf', value: 'conf'},
      {label: '.json', value: 'json'},
      {label: '.properties', value: 'properties'}
    ]}>

  <TabItem value="conf">

  ```json
    user {
      "password:masked" = "secret"
    }
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="json">

  ```json
    {
      "user": {
        "password:masked": "secret"
      }
    }
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="properties">

  ```properties
    user.password\:masked = secret
  ```

  *Note*: You will need to escape `:` as `\:` in properties files

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

Alternatively, you can pass a masked setting directly to the [Gwen CLI](/docs/cli) as a system property if you don't wish to store it in a file:

```shell
-Duser.password:masked=secret
```

## Using masked settings

To use a masked setting, just reference it anywhere you need to using it's name (excluding the `:masked` suffix).

Example:

```gherkin
  When I enter "${user.password}" in the password field
```

When evaluated, the above will be logged as follows in all outputs:

```gherkin
  When I enter "*****" in the password field
```

:::caution

It is your resposibility to enter sensitive data such as passwords into password protected fields to prevent them from being displayed in the browser.

## Custom mask character

You can change the default mask character from `*` to another character of your choice by assigning it to the [`gwen.mask.char`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-mask-char) setting.

# Get Started

:::tip

Learn the key Gwen concepts in our [introduction](introduction) before you start.

:::

## Prerequisites
- Linux, Mac or Windows OS
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge or IE web browser
- Java SE 8+
  - In order to run Gwen, you need to have a Java runtime environment installed. You can check by running `java -version` in a terminal window. A version will be displayed if you do. If not, [install Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).


## Project setup

<Tabs
  defaultValue="standalone"
  values={[
    {label: 'Standalone Project', value: 'standalone'},
    {label: 'Workspace Project', value: 'workspace'},
    {label: 'JS Project', value: 'js'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="standalone">

#### 1. Download and install

Perform the following to set up Gwen as a standalone project in a directory on your machine:

- Browse the [releases](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases) and download the binary `gwen-web-version.zip` package of the version you want to install and use
- Extract the downloaded ZIP into a desired directory

This will give you the following files and subdirectories:
```
 /gwen-web-version           # Your project root
 ├── gwen                    # Linux launch script
 ├── gwen.bat                # Windows launch script
 ├── /bin                    # Gwen scripts
 ├── /lib                    # Gwen binaries
 └── /samples                # Sample features and meta
 ```

:::caution No automatic updates

There are no automatic updates with the standalone approach. You will need to manage them manually.

:::

#### 2. Set your default browser

Gwen is configured to use the Chrome browser by default. To change it, create a new `gwen.properties` file in your standalone project directory and set the following setting to `chrome` ,`firefox`, `safari`, `edge`, or `ie`:

:::note Amend setting

*File: gwen.properties*

```properties
# default browser to use
gwen.web.browser = firefox
```

This example sets Firef ox as the default browser.

:::

#### 3. Execute the samples

Run the following command in your project root to execute the sample feature specs. An [evaluation report](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Evaluation-Reports) will be generated at `target/reports/index.html` in your project.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

:::note Launch Gwen

```console
./gwen -b -r target/reports samples
```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/REPL-Console) instead.
- The `-r` option sets the report output directory to `target/reports`
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute

#### 4. Add your own features and meta

Create a new `features` subdirectory in your project root and start adding your own features and meta there. Run the following command to execute your features:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing your features. Omitting it will open the [REPL](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/REPL-Console) instead.
- The `-r` option sets the report output directory to `target/reports`
- `features` is the directory containing your meta and feature files to execute

:::caution Deprecated

[Gwen workspaces](https://gweninterpreter.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/gwen-workspaces/) are deprecated in favor of JS projects coming soon to Gwen 3. 

:::

#### 1. Download and install

Perform the following to set up Gwen as a [workspace](https://gweninterpreter.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/gwen-workspaces/) project on your machine:

- Download and extract this [gwen-workspace.zip](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/latest/download/gwen-workspace.zip) into a desired location on your computer

This will give you the following files and subdirectories:
```
 /gwen-workspace             # Your project root
 ├── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
 ├── gwen                    # Linux launch script
 ├── gwen.bat                # Windows launch script
 ├── gwen.properties         # Gwen properties/settings
 ├── gwen-gpm.jar            # Gwen package manager JAR
 ├── /browsers               # Browser settings
 │   ├── chrome.properties   # - default is chrome
 │   ├── edge.properties
 │   ├── firefox.properties
 │   ├── safari.properties
 │   ├── ie.properties
 │   └── README.txt
 ├── /env                    # Environment settings
 │   ├── local.properties    # - default is local
 │   └── README.txt
 ├── /features               # Your feature/meta files go here
 └── /samples                # Sample features and meta
 ```

#### 2. Enable/Disable automatic updates

When you first launch Gwen in your workspace, it will take a little time to download the latest version of itself before starting. On subsequent launches it will start much faster and won't download anything again until we publish a new release in which case it will automatically update itself.

To turn off automatic updates, open the `gwen.properties` file in your workspace project directory in a text editor and amend the `gwen.gwen-web.version` property from `latest` to the version number of the [release](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases) you want to use.

:::note Amend setting

*File: gwen.properties*

```properties
# Gwen package version
# --------------------
# Gwen web version (specify desired version or latest for auto updates)
gwen.gwen-web.version=latest
```

:::

#### 3. Set your default browser and environment

Gwen workspaces are configured to use the Chrome browser and local environment properties by default. To change either or these, open the Gwen launch script in your workspace project directory and set the follwing variables:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

:::note Amend launch script

*File: gwen*
```console
# Defaults
DEFAULT_BROWSER="firefox"
DEFAULT_ENV="local"
```
Where:
- Browser options include: `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`, `edge`, or `ie`
- The environment is the name of a properties file in the `env` folder of your workspace

This example sets Firefox as the default browser and leaves the default environment as local.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

:::note Amend launch script

*File: gwen.bat*
```console
REM Defaults
SET DEFAULT_BROWSER=firefox
SET DEFAULT_ENV=local
```
Where:
- Browser options include: `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`, `edge`, or `ie`
- The environment is the name of a properties file in the `env` folder of your workspace

This example sets Firefox as the default browser and leaves the default environment as local.

#### 4. Execute the samples

Run the following command in your project root to execute the sample feature specs. An [evaluation report](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Evaluation-Reports) will be generated at `target/reports/index.html` in your project.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"

    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

:::note Launch Gwen

```console
./gwen -b samples
```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/REPL-Console) instead.
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute

#### 5. Add your own features and meta

Start adding your own features and meta to the `features` directory in your workspace. Run the following command to execute your features:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

:::note Launch Gwen

To use the default browser and env/local.properties settings:
```console
./gwen -b features
```
To use the Edge browser and env/local.properties settings:
```console
./gwen edge -b features

To use the default browser and env/dev.properties settings:
```console
./gwen dev -b features
```
To use the Edge browser and env/dev.properties settings:
```console

```

Where:

- The first optional arguments are:
  - `browser` - the specified browser or default if absent
  - `environment` - the specified environment or default if absent

#### 6. Share your project with your team

Push your project to a Git repository and share it with your team. A `.gitignore` file that excludes the `target` output directory is included. You can keep or delete the samples subdirectory (up to you).

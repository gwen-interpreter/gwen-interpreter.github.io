#### 1. Download and install Gwen

- Browse the [releases](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases) and download the binary `gwen-web-<version>.zip` package of the version you want to install and use
- Extract the downloaded ZIP into a desired directory

This will give you the following file system setup:
```
 /gwen-web-<version>         # Your installation root
 ├── gwen                    # Linux launch script
 ├── gwen.bat                # Windows launch script
 ├── /bin                    # Gwen scripts
 ├── /lib                    # Gwen binaries
 └── /samples                # Sample features and meta
 ```

#### 2. Add Gwen to your system path

Add the absolute location of your `gwen-web-<version>/bin` directory to your system `PATH` to make Gwen available in any directory on your machine.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

:::note set PATH variable

Run the following command to set the `PATH` in your current session temporarily or consult your OS manual to make it permanent:

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/absolute/path/to/gwen-web-<version>/bin
```

Replace:
- `/absolute/path/to` with the absolute path to the location where you extracted the ZIP in step 1
- `<version>` with the Gwen version you installed

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

:::note set PATH variable

Go to *Environment Variables* on your Windows system, and find and edit the `PATH` variable to include the following.

```shell
C:\absolute\path\to\gwen-web-<version>\bin
```

Replace:
- `C:\absolute\path\to` with the absolute path to the location where you extracted the ZIP in step 1
- `<version>` with the Gwen version you installed

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::caution No automatic updates

You will need repeat steps 1 and 2 to udpate.

:::

#### 3. Set your default browser

Gwen is configured to use the Chrome browser by default. To change it, create a new `gwen.properties` file in your user directory and set the following setting to your preferred default:

:::note Amend setting

*File: gwen.properties*

```properties
# default browser to use
gwen.web.browser = firefox
```

Where:
- Browser options include: `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`, `edge`, or `ie`

This example sets Firefox as the default browser.

:::

#### 4. Execute the samples

Run the following command in your installation directory to execute the sample feature specs.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

:::note Launch Gwen

```shell
gwen -b -r output/reports samples
```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL Console](/docs/cli/repl) instead of exiting.
- The `-r` option sets the report output directory to `output/reports`
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute 

[CLI usage](/docs/cli/launcher)

:::

An [evaluation report](/docs/reports/html) will be generated at `output/reports/index.html` in your directory.

<TabItem value="windows">

:::note Launch Gwen

```shell

```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL Console](/docs/cli/repl) instead of exiting.
- The `-r` option sets the report output directory to `output\reports`
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute

#### 5. Create and execute your own meta and features

Create a new `features` directory in a preferred location on your machine and start adding your own feature and meta files there. Run the following command in the parent directory to execute them:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing your features. Omitting it will open the [REPL Console](/docs/cli/repl) instead of exiting.
- The `-r` option sets the report output directory to `output/reports`
- `features` is the directory containing your meta and feature files to execute

<TabItem value="workspace">

Use this option set up a [Gwen workspace](https://gweninterpreter.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/gwen-workspaces/) that can run on any machine.

:::caution Deprecated

[Gwen workspaces](https://gweninterpreter.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/gwen-workspaces/) were introduced in Gwen 2 and will be unsupported in Gwen 3+ in favor of JS projects.

#### 1. Download and extract workspace

- Download and extract this [gwen-workspace.zip](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/latest/download/gwen-workspace.zip) into a desired location on your computer

This will give you the following file system setup:
```
 /gwen-workspace             # Your workspace root
 ├── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
 ├── gwen                    # Linux launch script
 ├── gwen.bat                # Windows launch script
 ├── gwen.properties         # Gwen properties/settings
 ├── gwen-gpm.jar            # Gwen package manager JAR
 ├── /browsers               # Browser settings
 │   ├── chrome.properties   # - default is chrome
 │   ├── edge.properties
 │   ├── firefox.properties
 │   ├── safari.properties
 │   ├── ie.properties
 │   └── README.txt
 ├── /env                    # Environment settings
 │   ├── local.properties    # - default is local
 │   └── README.txt
 ├── /features               # Your feature & meta files go here
 └── /samples                # Sample features and meta
 ```

#### 2. Enable/Disable automatic updates

When you first launch Gwen in your workspace, it will take a little time to download the latest version of itself before starting. On subsequent launches it will start much faster and won't download anything again until we publish a new release in which case it will automatically update itself.

To turn off automatic updates, open the `gwen.properties` file in your workspace directory in a text editor and amend the `gwen.gwen-web.version` property from `latest` to the version number of the [release](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases) you want to use.

:::note Amend setting

*File: gwen.properties*

```properties
# Gwen package version
# --------------------
# Gwen web version (specify desired version or latest for auto updates)
gwen.gwen-web.version = latest
```

:::

#### 3. Set your default browser and environment

Gwen workspaces are configured to use the Chrome browser and local environment properties by default. To change either or these, open the Gwen launch script in your workspace directory and set the following variables to your preferred defaults:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

:::note Amend launch script

*File: gwen*
```shell
DEFAULT_BROWSER="firefox"
DEFAULT_ENV="local"
```
Where:
- Browser options include: `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`, `edge`, or `ie`
- The environment is the name of a properties file in the `env` folder of your workspace

This example sets Firefox as the default browser and leaves the default environment as local.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

:::note Amend launch script

*File: gwen.bat*
```shell
SET DEFAULT_BROWSER=firefox
SET DEFAULT_ENV=local
```
Where:
- Browser options include: `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`, `edge`, or `ie`
- The environment is the name of a properties file in the `env` folder of your workspace

This example sets Firefox as the default browser and leaves the default environment as local.

#### 4. Execute the samples

Run the following command in your workspace directory to execute the sample feature specs.

<Tabs

    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

:::note Launch Gwen

```shell
./gwen -b samples
```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL Console](/docs/cli/repl) instead of exiting.
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute 

[CLI usage](/docs/cli/launcher)

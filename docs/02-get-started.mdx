# Get Started

:::tip

See the [introduction](/docs/introduction) to learn more about Gwen before getting started.

:::

## Setup

#### Choose a setup option

<Tabs
  groupId="setup"
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    {label: 'JS Project', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'Standalone', value: 'standalone'},
    {label: 'Workspace', value: 'workspace'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="js">

Use this option to add Gwen to a JS project.

### System requirements
- Linux, Mac or Windows OS
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge browser
- Java 8+ ([install Java](https://java.com))
- node 12+ ([install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))

### Add Gwen to your JS project and initialise

:::note

If you don't have a JS project, you can create one by installing node and running `npm init` in a new directory and use that.

:::

Open a terminal in the root of your project and run the following commands to add Gwen as a dev dependency and initialise your project for Gwen:

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

Install the gwen-web package:

```shell
npm i --save-dev @gweninterpreter/gwen-web
```

In the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file, add the following entry:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "gwen": "gwen"
  }
}
```

Then, initialize Gwen in the project by running:

```shell
npm run gwen init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add -D @gweninterpreter/gwen-web
yarn gwen init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm add -D @gweninterpreter/gwen-web
pnpm gwen init
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `init` command will generate the following files and subdirectories in your project:

```
 /js-project                 # Your JS project root
 ├── gwen.conf               # Project settings
 └── /gwen
     ├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
     ├── README.md
     ├── /browsers           # Browser settings
     │   ├── chrome.conf
     │   ├── edge.conf
     │   ├── firefox.conf
     │   ├── safari.conf
     │   ├── ie.conf
     │   ├── remote.conf     # Remote web driver settings
     │   └── README.md
     ├── /env                # Environment settings
     │   ├── local.conf
     │   ├── dev.conf
     │   ├── test.conf
     │   └── README.md
     ├── /features           # Features and associative meta
     │   └── README.md
     ├── /meta               # Optional common/reusable meta
     │   └── README.md
     └── /samples            # Sample features and meta
```

:::info Automatic Updates

Automatic installs and updates to the latest version of Gwen are enabled by default for JS projects. You can disable them by setting the `version` field in the `gwenWeb` section of your `package.json` file to a specific version.

```json
"gwenWeb": {
  "version": "3.0.0"
}
```

Setting it back to `latest` will re-enable automatic updates.

:::

### Set your default browser

Gwen is configured to use the Chrome browser by default. To change this default, amend the  [<code>gwen.target.browser</code>](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-target-browser) setting in your `/js-project/gwen.conf` file to load your preferred browser settings instead of chrome.

:::note Amend setting

*File: /js-project/gwen.conf*

```json {3}
gwen {
  target {
    browser = "chrome"            # <- Change to firefox, safari, edge, or ie
  }
}
```

:::

#### Web driver settings

Gwen has an embedded web driver manager which automatically downloads and installs native web drivers for you on most platforms. If however you need to manage this manually, see [Web Driver Management](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Web-Driver-Management) and [Web Settings](/docs/settings/reference#web-settings) for options.

### Execute the samples

<Tabs

    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

:::note Launch Gwen

Run the following command in your project to execute the sample feature specs.

```shell
npm run gwen -- -b gwen/samples
```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL Console](/docs/cli/repl) instead of exiting.
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute

A [HTML evaluation report](/docs/reports/html) will be generated at `gwen/output/reports/index.html` in your project.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="standalone">

Use this option to set up Gwen as a standalone installation on your machine.

### System requirements
- Linux, Mac or Windows OS
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge browser
- Java 8+ ([install Java](https://java.com))

### Download and install Gwen

Browse the [releases](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases) and download the binary package of the version you want to install and use. The donwloaded zip will have a name that matches *gwen-web-&lt;version&gt;.zip*. Extract the downloaded ZIP into a dedicated applications directory on your machine. This will give you the following Gwen insallation on your file system:

```
 /applications             # Your top level applications directory
 └──/gwen-web-<version>    # Your Gwen install
    ├── gwen               # Linux launch script
    ├── gwen.bat           # Windows launch script
    ├── /bin               # Gwen scripts
    └── /lib               # Gwen binaries
```

### Add Gwen to your system path

Add the absolute location of your `/applications/gwen-web-<version>/bin` directory to your system `PATH` variable to make Gwen accessible in any directory on your machine.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

:::note set PATH variable

Run the following command to set the `PATH` in your current session temporarily or consult your OS manual to make it permanent:

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/absolute/path/to/applications/gwen-web-<version>/bin
```

Replace:
- `/absolute/path/to` with the absolute path to the location where you extracted the ZIP in step 1
- `<version>` with the Gwen version you installed

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

:::note set PATH variable

Go to *Environment Variables* on your Windows system, and find and edit the `PATH` variable to include the following.

```shell
C:\absolute\path\to\applications\gwen-web-<version>\bin
```

Replace:
- `C:\absolute\path\to` with the absolute path to the location where you extracted the ZIP in step 1 (your drive letter may differ)
- `<version>` with the Gwen version you installed

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::caution No automatic updates

You will need to repeat the above to udpate.

:::

### Inititialise a project directory

Create a new directory (called `gwen-project` for example) somewhere on your machine that will serve as your working Gwen project directory. It should be outside of the `/applications` directory where you installed Gwen earlier. Open a terminal and run the following command in your `gwen-project` directory to initialise it:

:::note Launch Gwen

Be sure to include the trailing dot

```shell
gwen init .
```

[Gwen CLI](/docs/cli)

:::

The `init` command will generate the following files and subdirectorie in your project:

```
 /gwen-project           # Your standalone project root
 ├── gwen.conf           # Project settings
 ├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
 ├── README.md
 ├── /browsers           # Browser settings
 │   ├── chrome.conf
 │   ├── edge.conf
 │   ├── firefox.conf
 │   ├── safari.conf
 │   ├── ie.conf
 │   ├── remote.conf     # Remote web driver settings
 │   └── README.md
 ├── /env                # Environment settings
 │   ├── local.conf
 │   ├── dev.conf
 │   ├── test.conf
 │   └── README.md
 ├── /features           # Features and associative meta
 │   └── README.md
 ├── /meta               # Optional common/reusable meta
 │   └── README.md
 └── /samples            # Sample features and meta
```

### Set your default browser

Gwen is configured to use the Chrome browser by default. To change this default, amend the  [<code>gwen.cli.options.conf</code>](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-cli-options-conf) setting in your `/gwen-project/gwen.conf` file to load your preferred browser settings instead of chrome.

:::note Amend setting

*File: /gwen-project/gwen.conf*

```json {5}
gwen {
  cli {
    options {
      config = [
        "browsers/chrome.conf", // <- Change to firefox, safari, edge, or ie
        "env/local.conf"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For example, to change it to Firefox, amend the highlighted settings line above to:
```json
"browsers/firefox.conf",
```

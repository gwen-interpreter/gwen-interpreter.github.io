# Get Started

:::tip

[Learn more](/docs) about Gwen before getting started.

:::

## Setup

#### Choose a setup option

The Project option is recommended since everything will be self contained and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) ready.

<Tabs
  groupId="setup"
  defaultValue="project"
  values={[
    {label: 'Project', value: 'project'},
    {label: 'Standalone', value: 'standalone'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="project">

> Since [Gwen 3](/docs/gwen3)

Use this option to start a new project or add Gwen to an existing one.

### System requirements
  - Linux, Mac or Windows OS
  - Before you can start, you will need to have the following installed:
    - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/au/safari/) browser
    - [Java 11+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
    - [node 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

### Open a terminal session

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="new"
  values={[
    {label: 'New project', value: 'new'},
    {label: 'Existing project', value: 'existing'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="new">
To start a new project, create a new directory and open a terminal window in that.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="existing">
To add Gwen to an existing project, open a terminal window in the root of that project.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Add Gwen and initialise

Add Gwen using one of the following tools ([Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended for ease of use).

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="yarn">

Install the gwen-web package as a dev dependency:

```shell
yarn add -D @gweninterpreter/gwen-web
```

Then, initialize Gwen in the project by running:

```shell
yarn gwen init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

Install the gwen-web package as a dev dependency in your project:

```shell
npm i --save-dev @gweninterpreter/gwen-web
```

Then, initialize Gwen in the project by running:

```shell
npm run gwen init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

Install the gwen-web package as a dev dependency in your project:

```shell
pnpm add -D @gweninterpreter/gwen-web
```

Then, initialize Gwen in the project by running:

```shell
pnpm gwen init
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `init` command will generate the following files and subdirectories in your project:

```
  ./                           # Project root
   ├── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
   ├── README.md
   ├── gwen.conf               # Gwen settings file
   └── /gwen
       ├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
       ├── /browsers           # Browser settings

       ├── /env                # Environment settings
       │   ├── dev.conf
       │   ├── local.conf
       │   ├── prod.conf
       │   ├── README.md
       │   ├── staging.conf
       │   └── test.conf
       ├── /features           # Features and associative meta
       │   └── README.md
       ├── /meta               # Optional common/reusable meta
       │   └── README.md
       └── /samples            # Sample features and meta
```

:::info Automatic Updates

Automatic installs and updates to the latest version of Gwen are enabled by default for projects. You can disable them by setting the `version` field in the `gwenWeb` section of your `package.json` file to a specific version.

```json
"gwenWeb": {
  "version": "X.Y.Z"
}
```

Omitting or setting it to `latest` will re-enable automatic updates.

:::

### Review default settings

All the default [settings](/docs/settings) for your project are pre-configured in the `gwen.conf` file in the root of your project (created by the `init` command). You can change any of them at any time to suit your needs. 

#### Default web browser and target environment

Gwen is configured to target the Chrome browser and your *test* environment by default. To change these, amend the  [<code>gwen.target.browser</code>](/docs/settings#gwen-target-browser) and [<code>gwen.target.env</code>](/docs/settings#gwen-target-env) settings to your preferred values.

:::note Amend settings

#### Gherkin style

The following defaults are pre-configured to help promote [good Gherkin](https://gweninterpreter.wordpress.com/2020/03/09/strictly-good-gherkin-with-gwen/) practice:

- [`gwen.feature.mode`](/docs/settings#gwen-feature-mode) is set to `declarative` to confine your [DSL](/docs/dsl) usage to [meta](/docs/meta) and keep your features clean
- [`gwen.behavior.rules`](/docs/settings#gwen-behavior-rules) is set to `strict` to enforce proper [behavioural rules](/docs#behavioural-rules-and-semantics) and *Given-When-Then* order

You can relax these by setting them to `imperative` and `lenient` (respectively) if you find them too rigid.

#### Web driver settings

Gwen has an embedded web driver manager which automatically downloads and installs native web drivers for you on most platforms. If however you need to manage this manually, see [Web Driver Management](/docs/web-driver-management) and [Web Settings](/docs/settings#web-settings) for options.

### Execute the samples

To confirm your setup, execute the samples in the `gwen/samples` directory and delete (or keep) them when done.

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="yarn">

:::note Launch Gwen

Run the following command in your project to execute the samples.

```shell
yarn gwen -b gwen/samples
```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL Console](/docs/repl) instead of exiting.
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute 

[Gwen CLI](/docs/cli)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

:::note Launch Gwen

Run the following command in your project to execute the samples.

```shell
npm run gwen -- -b gwen/samples
```

Where:

- The `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing the samples. Omitting it will open the [REPL Console](/docs/repl) instead of exiting.
- `samples` is the directory containing the meta and feature samples to execute

The sample features will execute and a [HTML evaluation report](/docs/reports/html) will be generated at `gwen/output/reports/index.html` in your project.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="standalone">

> Since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

Use this option to set up Gwen as a once-off standalone installation on your machine.

### System requirements
  - Linux, Mac or Windows OS
  - Before you can start, you will need to have the following installed:
    - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/au/safari/) browser
    - [Java 11+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

### Download and install Gwen

Browse the [releases](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases) and download the binary package of the version you want to install and use. The donwloaded zip will have a name that matches *gwen-web-&lt;version&gt;.zip*. Extract the downloaded ZIP into a dedicated applications directory on your machine. This will give you the following Gwen insallation on your file system:

```
 /applications             # Your top level applications directory
 └──/gwen-web-<version>    # Your Gwen install
    ├── gwen               # Linux launch script
    ├── gwen.bat           # Windows launch script
    ├── /bin               # Gwen scripts
    └── /lib               # Gwen binaries
```

### Add Gwen to your system path

Add the absolute location of your `/applications/gwen-web-<version>/bin` directory to your system `PATH` variable to make Gwen accessible in any directory on your machine.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

:::note set PATH variable

Run the following command to set the `PATH` in your current session temporarily or consult your OS manual to make it permanent:

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/absolute/path/to/applications/gwen-web-<version>/bin
```

Replace:
- `/absolute/path/to` with the absolute path to the location where you extracted the ZIP in step 1
- `<version>` with the Gwen version you installed

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

:::note set PATH variable

Go to *Environment Variables* on your Windows system, and find and edit the `PATH` variable to include the following.

```shell
C:\absolute\path\to\applications\gwen-web-<version>\bin
```

Replace:
- `C:\absolute\path\to` with the absolute path to the location where you extracted the ZIP in step 1 (your drive letter may differ)
- `<version>` with the Gwen version you installed

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::caution No automatic updates

You will need to repeat the above to udpate.

:::

### Inititialise a project directory

Create a new directory (called `gwen-project` for example) somewhere on your machine that will serve as your working Gwen project directory. It should be outside of the `/applications` directory where you installed Gwen earlier. Open a terminal and run the following command in your `gwen-project` directory to initialise it:

:::note Launch Gwen

Be sure to include the trailing dot

```shell
gwen init .
```

[Gwen CLI](/docs/cli)

:::

The `init` command will generate the following files and subdirectorie in your project:

```
  ./                       # Project root
   ├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
   ├── README.md

#### Gherkin style

The following settings are pre-configured with [strictly good Gherkin](https://gweninterpreter.wordpress.com/2020/03/09/strictly-good-gherkin-with-gwen/) in mind:

- [`gwen.feature.mode`](/docs/settings#gwen-feature-mode) is set to *declarative* to help keep your features high level and declarative
- [`gwen.behavior.rules`](/docs/settings#gwen-behavior-rules) is set to *strict* to enforce proper behavioural semantics and Given-When-Then order

You can relax these by setting them to *imperative* and *lenient* instead if you find them too rigid.

# Interactive

## REPL

> Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0">v1.0.0</Link>

By default, Gwen will run in interactive mode which means it will start the [REPL console](/docs/cli/repl) as soon as it finishes executing features. This allows you to interactively enter commands to analyse the state of the  environment or to continue entering additional steps. This is useful for testing the execution of features and verifying additional steps you want to add.

## Debugging

### Breakpoints

> Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.2.0">v3.2.0</Link>

Breakpoints can be added to any feature or meta steps by prefixing their expressions with `@Breakpoint `. These are ignored unless debugging is explicitly enabled with the [-d|--debug](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-debug) CLI option.

#### Example

:::note Breakpoint in feature file

*File: features/todo.feature*
```gherkin {9}
Feature: Add todo items
 
  Scenario: Create todo list
    Given a new todo list
     When the following items are added
          | Item          |
          | Get the milk  |
          | Walk the dog  |
     Then @Breakpoint the list will contain 2 items
```

:::

:::info
To activate breakpoints, launch Gwen in debug mode by specifying the [-d|--debug](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-debug) CLI option. 
:::

When a breakpoint on a step is encountered and debugging is enabled, Gwen will pause execution, open the [REPL](/docs/cli/repl), and prompt the user to continue execution from that step or to quit (or to perform other [REPL operations](/docs/cli/repl#repl-commands)).

:::note Sample breakpoint prompt in REPL

```text {10-15}
Feature: Add todo items

  Scenario: Create todo list
    Given a new todo list  [6s 344ms] Passed
     When the following items are added
          | Item         |
          | Get the milk |
          | Walk the dog |  [2s 200ms] Passed

Paused at features/todo.feature:9
     Then the list will contain 2 items

Enter c to continue or q to quit (or type help for more options)..

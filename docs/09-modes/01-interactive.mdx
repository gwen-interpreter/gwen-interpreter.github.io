# Interactive

## REPL

> Since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

Gwen will open the [REPL console](/docs/cli/repl) when it finishes executing features unless [batch](/docs/modes/batch) mode is enabled.

## Debugging

### Breakpoints

> Since [v3.2.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

Breakpoints can be added to any feature or meta steps by prefixing their expressions with `@Breakpoint `. These are ignored unless debugging is explicitly enabled with the [-d|--debug](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-debug) CLI option.

#### Example

:::note Breakpoint in feature file

*File: features/todo.feature*
```gherkin {9}
Feature: Add todo items
 
  Scenario: Create todo list
    Given a new todo list
     When the following items are added
          | Item          |
          | Get the milk  |
          | Walk the dog  |
     Then @Breakpoint the list will contain 2 items
```

:::

:::info
To activate breakpoints, launch Gwen in debug mode by specifying the [-d|--debug](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-debug) CLI option. 
:::

When a breakpoint on a step is encountered and debugging is enabled, Gwen will pause execution, open the [REPL](/docs/cli/repl), and prompt the user to continue execution from that step or to quit (or to perform other [REPL operations](/docs/cli/repl#repl-commands)).

:::note Sample breakpoint prompt in REPL

```shell {10-15}
Feature: Add todo items

  Scenario: Create todo list
    Given a new todo list  [6s 344ms] Passed
     When the following items are added
          | Item         |
          | Get the milk |
          | Walk the dog |  [2s 200ms] Passed
     Then @Breakpoint the list will contain 2 items

Paused at features/todo.feature:9
Enter c to continue or q to quit (or type help for more options)..

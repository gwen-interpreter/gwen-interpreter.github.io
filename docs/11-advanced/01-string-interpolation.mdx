# String Interpolation

It is often useful to reference settings, captured values and other text throughout your feature and meta files. To support this, Gwen provides a placholder substitution mechanism.

#### Placeholders

A placeholder can be:

- An environment variable name (since gwen-web 2.36.0)
  - example: `${env.USER}` for the `USER` variable
- A system property name
- A [Gwen setting](/docs/settings) name
- A named attribute in the currently accessible scope
 
## Examples

### Interpolation by Substitution

Substitution involves replacing named placeholders with their values.

```gherkin
 Feature: String Interpolation

Scenario: By Substitution
    
    Given my mechanism is "substitution"
      And my value is "${my.property}"
      And my proposition is "By ${my mechanism}, my value will be ${my value}"
     Then my proposition should be "By substitution, my value will be ${my.property}"
```

### Interpolation by Concatenation

:::caution Deprecated

The concatentation method has been deprecated in favor of substitition since [Gwen 3](/docs/gwen3) (dropped in <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.14.0">v3.14.0</Link>)

:::

Concatenation involves joining string literals and named values together.

```gherkin
 Feature: String Interpolation

Scenario: By Concatenation
    
    Given my mechanism is "concatenation"
      And my value is "" + my.property
      And my proposition is "By " + my mechanism + ", my value will be " + my value
     Then my proposition should be "By concatenation, my value will be " + my.property
```

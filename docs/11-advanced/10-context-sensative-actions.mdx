# Context Sensative Actions

## Performing actions on context sensitive elements
This feature adds support for performing actions on context sensitive elements. This is supported through the following DSL:

- [`I <click|right click|double click> <element> of <context>`](/docs/dsl/reference#i-click-element-of-context)

For example, say you wanted to click an action button in a menu item that only becomes visible when you physically hovering over it with the mouse. You can do this as follows:

```gherkin
  # define locators for the menu item and action button (as you normally would)
  Given the menu item can be located by id "menu-item-id"
    And the action button can be located by id "action-button-id"

  # then move into the menu item and click the action button
  When I click the action button of the menu item
```

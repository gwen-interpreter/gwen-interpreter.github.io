# String Interpolation

It is often useful to reference provided properties, captured values, and string literals throughout your features. Gwen provides two interpolation mechanisms for doing this:

- [Substitution](#interpolation-by-substitution) (recommended approach)
- [Concatenation](#interpolation-by-concatenation) (deprecated since [Gwen 3](/docs/gwen3))

Interpolation occurs in the interpreter on every step in a feature before it is passed to Gwen for execution.

#### Named Values

For interpolation purposes, a named value can be any one of the following:

- An environment variable (since gwen-web 2.36.0)
  - example: `${env.USER}` for the `USER` variable
- A system property
  - Passed to Gwen through a `-D` [JVM argument](/docs/cli#system-properties-and-jvm-options)
- A [Gwen setting](/docs/settings)
- A launch property
  - A property in a properties file passed to Gwen through the [config launch option](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-conf)
- A bound attribute
  - An attribute bound in the local, global, or current data scope
 
## Examples

In the examples below..
- `my.property` is a property
- `my mechanism` is an attribute assigned to a literal

### Interpolation by Substitution

> This is the recommended interpolation approach

Substitution involves replacing named value placeholders with their values.

```gherkin
 Feature: String Interpolation

Scenario: By Substitution
    
    Given my mechanism is "substitution"
      And my value is "${my.property}"
      And my proposition is "By ${my mechanism}, my value is ${my value}"
     Then my proposition should be "By substitution, my value is ${my.property}"
```

### Interpolation by Concatenation

:::caution Deprecated

The concatentation method has been deprecated in favor of substitition since [Gwen 3](/docs/gwen3) (dropped in <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.14.0">v3.14.0</Link>)

:::

Concatenation involves joining string literals and named values together.

```gherkin
 Feature: String Interpolation

Scenario: By Concatenation
    
    Given my mechanism is "concatenation"
      And my value is "" + my.property
      And my proposition is "By " + my mechanism + ", my value is " + my value
     Then my proposition should be "By concatenation, my value is " + my.property
```

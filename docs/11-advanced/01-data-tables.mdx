# Data Tables

## @DataTable and @ForEach

> Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.47.0">v2.47.0</Link>

Consider the following example step containing a [data table](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference#data-tables).

:::note Feature step with data table

```gherkin
  When the following items are added
       | Item          |
       | Get the milk  |
       | Walk the dog  |
```

This example defines a single column table containing a header followed by two entries.

:::

A [StepDef](/docs/meta#stepdefs) could be defined to process each row of data in the table as follows:

:::note StepDef for processing data table

```gherkin {2-3,7-8}
  @StepDef
  @DataTable
  @ForEach
  Scenario: the following items are added
    Given the todo field can be located by class "new-todo"
      And my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
     When I enter Item in the todo field
     Then my todo list should contain Item
```

This `StepDef` will be executed for each row of data in the table (2 times in this example)

:::

The `@DataTable` and `@ForEach` annotations work together to process each record in the data table. When the feature step is evaluated, Gwen will call the StepDef for each record in the table and bind each field value to its declared name in the header record. The last two steps in this example will enter each `Item` into a `todo field` and check that it was added to `my todo list`. 

### Implicit attributes

The following attributes are also implicitly available to data table StepDefs:

<details id="record-number">
  <summary class="setting">

  ```properties
  record.number
  ```
  <p>The current record number (first is 1)</p>

  </summary>

  <div class="grid-3">
    <div><Link to="#record-number">Link</Link></div>
    <div align="center"></div>
    <div align="right">Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.47.0">v2.47.0</Link></div>
  </div>
</details>

<details id="record-index">
  <summary class="setting">

  ```properties
  record.index
  ```
  <p>The current record index (first is 0)</p>

  </summary>

  <div class="grid-3">
    <div><Link to="#record-index">Link</Link></div>
    <div align="center"></div>
    <div align="right">Since <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.30.1">v2.30.1</Link></div>
  </div>
</details>

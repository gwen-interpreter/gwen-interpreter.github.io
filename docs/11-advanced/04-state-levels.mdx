# State Levels

> Since [v2.38.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.38.0)

Gwen maintains state for features and scenarios during execution based on your configured [`gwen.state.level`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-state-level) setting. If not configured, then Gwen will use feature level state by default.

## Feature Level State

> `gwen.state.level = feature` (default)

With feature level state, each feature will get a new state during execution. The same state will be shared across scenarios. So scenarios can share data between each other and access other feature-global data.

Scenario Level State
-------------------
> `gwen.state.level = scenario`

With scenario level state, each scenario will get a new state during execution. The same state will never be shared across scenarios. So scenarios cannot share data between each other and no feature-global data is available.

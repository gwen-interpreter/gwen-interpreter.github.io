  <summary class="dsl">

  ```gherkin
  there should be no accumulated errors
  ```

  <p>Checks that no errors were raised prior to this been called and raises all accumulated error messages (if any) in one assertion error.</p>
  </summary>

  <p>Example</p>

  ```gherkin {4} showLineNumbers
    Then @Soft x should not be blank
     And @Soft y should be "1"
     And @Soft z should be true
     And there should be no accumulated errors
  ```

  Line 4 will pass if all the preceeding assertions pass. If however, the assertions on line 1 and 3 fail (and the one on line 2 passes), then it will raise an assertion error containing the two messages as follows:

  ```
  2 errors:
  (1) x should not be blank
  (2) z should be true but got false
  ```

<details id="i-reset-accumulated-errors">
  <summary class="dsl">

  ```gherkin
  I reset accumulated errors
  ```

  <p>Resets (clears) any previously accumulated errors.</p>
  </summary>

  <p>Example</p>

  ```gherkin {1} showLineNumbers
    When I reset accumulated errors
    Then @Soft x should not be blank
     And @Soft y should be "1"
     And @Soft z should be true
     And there should be no accumulated errors
  ```

  Line 1 will clear any previously accumulated errors from the currently executing context.

  So only the messages of all failed assertions leading up to line 4 will be included.

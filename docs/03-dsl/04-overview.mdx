# DSL Overview

## DSL Steps

Every Gherkin step starts with a `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`, or `*` keyword followed by a step expression. 
A step with an expression that matches a supported DSL expression is considered a DSL step and as such is directly executable without requiring a StepDef. Gwen executes all DSL steps out of the box.

DSL steps are used to compose imperative operations in StepDefs to make non-DSL steps in features executable.

:::note Example

The following is DSL Step:

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
```

Since it matches a supported DSL expression:

- [`the page title <should|should not> <be|contain|start with|end with|match regex|match xpath|match template|match template file> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#the-page-title-shouldshould-not-becontainstart-withend-withmatch-regexmatch-xpathmatch-templatematch-template-file-expression)

### They belong in meta

Use DSL steps in your meta and not in your feature specs. Meta is designed to be "DSL aware" and imperative. Features are not!

:::info Coming to Gwen 3
We are planning to ban DSL steps from features by default in the upcomming Gwen 3 release by defaulting the [`gwen.feature.mode`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings#gwenfeaturemode) setting to `declarative` instead of `imperative`.

## Execution rules

Gwen executes every step in a feature or meta spec according to the following rules (in the order shown):

1. StepDef rule
   - If the step is bound to a StepDef then these rules will be applied to each step in the body of that StepDef
2. DSL rule
   - If the step is a DSL step then Gwen will execute it using the preprogrammed DSL code in its engine
3. Undefined rule
   - If neither of the above rules are satisfied then Gwen will report an undefined step error

:::tip All execution happens in DSL steps
Every step will directly or indirectly through StepDefs result in one or more DSL steps that will execute or undefined steps that will not.

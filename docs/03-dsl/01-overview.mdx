# DSL Overview

Every Gherkin steps that matches a prescribed [DSL Step](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps) is readily executable by Gwen.

:::note Example

The following is a DSL Step:

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
```

Since it matches:

- [`the page title should[ not] <match> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps#the-page-title-should-match-expression)

:::

## All execution happens in the DSL

Every step interpreted by Gwen will directly or inderectly through StepDefs result in either:
- One or many DSL steps being executed
- One or many undefined steps being reported
- Or a combination of the above

If you've got everything right, all steps will execute. It is your job as a Gwen user to define StepDefs for every non DSL step in your features (and in your meta if you introduce any there). 

:::tip

Use [dry runs](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Execution-Modes#dry-run-execution-and-validation) to check for syntax and binding errors and identify any missing StepDefs before committing to an automation cycle.

:::note Step execution rules

Gwen interprets steps for execution according to the following rules:

1. StepDef rule
   - If the step is bound to a StepDef then apply these rules to every step in the body of that StepDef
2. DSL rule
   - If the step is a DSL step then execute it using built-in code
3. Undefined rule
   - If neither of the above rules are satisfied then report an undefined step error

## Compose StepDefs with DSL steps

To make the following feature step executable:

:::note Step in feature

*File: features/todo.feature*

```gherkin
  Given a new todo list
```

:::

You could compose a StepDef as follows:

:::note StepDef in meta

*File: features/todo.meta*

```gherkin {4-7}
  @Context
  @StepDef
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
       When I navigate to "https://todomvc.com/examples/react"
       Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
        And my todo list should not be displayed
```

Calls DSL steps:

- [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression)
- [`I navigate to <url>`](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps#i-navigate-to-url)
- [`the page title should[ not] <match> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps#the-page-title-should-match-expression)
- [`<element> should[ not] be <state>`](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps#element-should-be-state)

:::info Coming to Gwen 3

We are planning to discourage the use of DSL steps in features in the upcomming Gwen 3 release by defaulting the [`gwen.feature.mode`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings#gwenfeaturemode) setting to `declarative` instead of `imperative`.

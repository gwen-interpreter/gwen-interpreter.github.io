# DSL Overview

All Gherkin steps that match the prescribed [DSL Steps](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps) are readily executable by Gwen.

:::note Example

The following is a DSL Step:

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
```

Since it matches the prescribed the DSL step:

- [`the page title <should|should not> <be|contain|start with|end with|match regex|match xpath|match template|match template file> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#the-page-title-shouldshould-not-becontainstart-withend-withmatch-regexmatch-xpathmatch-templatematch-template-file-expression)

:::

## All execution happens in the DSL

Every step interpreted by Gwen will directly or inderectly through StepDefs result in either:
- one or many DSL steps being executed
- one or many undefined steps being reported
- or a combination of the above

If you've got everything right, all steps will execute. It is your job as a Gwen user to define StepDefs for all non DSL steps in your features (and in your meta if you introduce any there). You can execute [dry runs](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Execution-Modes#dry-run-execution-and-validation) to check for undefined steps and any syntax or binding errors before committing to an automation cycle.

:::note Step execution rules

Gwen interprets steps for execution according to the following rules:

1. StepDef rule
   - If the step is bound to a StepDef then apply these rules to every step in the body of that StepDef
2. DSL rule
   - If the step is a DSL step then execute it using built-in code
3. Undefined rule
   - If neither of the above rules are satisfied then report an undefined step error

## Compose StepDefs with DSL steps

:::tip

Use DSL steps in your meta to compose StepDefs. Although it's possible to use them directly in features, we do not recommend writing DSL-aware features. That's what meta is for!

:::

To make the following feature step executable:

:::note Step in feature

*File: features/todo.feature*

```gherkin
  Given a new todo list
```

:::

You could compose a StepDef as follows:

:::note StepDef in meta

*File: features/todo.meta*

```gherkin {4-7}
  @Context
  @StepDef
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
       When I navigate to "https://todomvc.com/examples/react"
       Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
        And my todo list should not be displayed
```

Calls DSL steps:

- [`<element> can be located by <id|name|tag name|tag|css selector|css|xpath|class name|class|link text|partial link text|javascript|js> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#element-can-be-located-by-idnametag-nametagcss-selectorcssxpathclass-nameclasslink-textpartial-link-textjavascriptjs-expression)
- [I navigate to `url`](/docs/dsl/dsl-steps#i-navigate-to-url)
- [`the page title <should|should not> <be|contain|start with|end with|match regex|match xpath|match template|match template file> "<expression>"`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#the-page-title-shouldshould-not-becontainstart-withend-withmatch-regexmatch-xpathmatch-templatematch-template-file-expression)
- [`<element> <should|should not> be <displayed|hidden|checked|ticked|unchecked|unticked|enabled|disabled>`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Supported-DSL#element-shouldshould-not-be-displayedhiddencheckedtickeduncheckeduntickedenableddisabled)

:::info Coming to Gwen 3

We are planning to discourage the use of DSL steps in features in the upcomming Gwen 3 release by defaulting the [`gwen.feature.mode`](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings#gwenfeaturemode) setting to `declarative` instead of `imperative`.

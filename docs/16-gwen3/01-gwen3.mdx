# Gwen 3 Release

## What's New

### Add Gwen to your JS project

You can now [add Gwen to projects](/docs/get-started) using npm and have all your executable Gherkin living next to your code and integrated into your development and testing process.

Thanks to [Ruby Juric](https://github.com/Sorixelle) for building [gwen-web-npm](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web-npm).

### `Init` project command

A new [`gwen init`](/docs/cli#init-command) command initialises Gwen in your project directory by creating the following:

- Project, browser, and environment level settings files
- Feature and meta subdirectories
- Sample feature and meta files
- Docker files
- Jenkins pipeline file

You also get automatic gwen udpates by default.

### HOCON and JSON settings

Two new [settings](/docs/settings) formats are now supported in addition to properties:

- [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation)
  - A superset of JSON
- JSON
  - Pure JSON format

### Better defaults for better Gherkin

The [`gwen.feature.mode`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-feature-mode) setting now defaults to *declarative* instead of *imperative* to keep DSL steps confined to meta and out of feature specifications.

The [`gwen.behavior.rules`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-behavior-rules) setting now defaults to *strict* instead of *lenient* to enforce correct behavioural semantics and proper Given-When-Then order.

### Pretty logging

Gwen now logs pretty execution results to the [console](/docs/reports/console).

![Example pretty log](/img/log/gwen-pretty-log.png)

#### New CLI option for verbose logging

Use the new `-v|--verbose` CLI option for verbose logging instead (equivalent to Gwen 2 logging).

### Configurable CLI options

CLI options are now [configurable](/docs/settings/reference#cli-settings) enabling you to customize your own Gwen launch profile.

### Selenium 4

The embedded web engine now uses Selenium 4

New DSLs have been added to support:

- [Relative locators](/docs/dsl/reference#relative-locators)
- [Windows and tabs](/docs/dsl/reference#windows-and-tabs)
- [Element level screenshots](/docs/dsl/reference#element-level-screenshots)

Support for W3C compliant capabilities has been added, since [v3.20.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.20.0):
- [Setting capabilites via protocol extensions](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-web-capabilities)

## What's dropped

- Gwen workspaces have been dropped in favor of Gwen projects
- Applitools integration has been removed
- [Interpolation](/docs/advanced/string-interpolation#interpolation-by-substitution) by concatenation deprecated in favor of substitution (dropped in <Link to="https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.14.0">v3.14.0</Link>)

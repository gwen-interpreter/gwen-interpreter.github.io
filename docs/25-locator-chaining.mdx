# Locator Chaining

> Since [v1.1.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

Gwen has a [locator](/docs/dsl/bindings/element-locators) chaining mechanism allowing you to locate elements within other elements or frames. 

## Locating elements in frames

For example, to locate a dropdown box inside a frame, you can chain two locators together like this:

```gherkin
  Given my frame can be located by id "frame_id"
    And my dropdown box can be located by name "dropdown_name" in my frame
```

And then just use the dropdown box:

```gherkin
  When I select "Gwen" in my dropdown box
```

## Locating elements in other elements

To locate an input element in a form, you can chain two locators together like this:

```gherkin
  Given my form can be located by name "form_name"
    And my input field can be located by name "input_name" in my form
```

Then just use the input field:

```gherkin
  When I enter "Gwen" in my input field
```

## Locating deeply nested elements

There is no limit to the number of locators you can chain. For example, you can define a locator for an input field in a form within a frame by chaining three locators together like this;

```gherkin
  Given my frame can be located by id "frame_id"
    And my form can be located by name "form_name" in my frame
    And my input field can be located by name "input_name" in my form
```

# Meta Specs

Meta specs are [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) specs that describe how feature steps will execute and are the automation glue in Gwen. They define all the step definitions and bindings required for automation and attach to features at runtime.

## StepDefs

### Composable step definitions

Step definitions are defined as <code>@StepDef</code> annotated [Scenarios](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#example) with names that match feature steps and bodies that call out to one or many [DSL steps](/docs/dsl/overview) to perform operations.

:::tip

Put all your step definitions in meta to keep your features clean and free of automation concerns.

:::

Consider the following feature step:

:::note Feature Step

*File: features/todo.feature*

```gherkin
  Given a new todo list
```

:::

A step definition for executing this could be defined in meta as follows:

:::note StepDef

*File: features/todo.meta*

```gherkin {2-3}
  @Context
  @StepDef
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given my todo list can be located by css ".todo-list"
       When I navigate to "${todo.page.url}"
       Then the page title should contain "TodoMVC"
        And my todo list should be hidden
```

Calls DSL steps:

- [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl/reference#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression)
- [`I navigate to "<url>"`](/docs/dsl/reference#i-navigate-to-url)
- [`the page title should[ not] <match> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl/reference#the-page-title-should-match-expression)
- [`<element> should[ not] be <state>`](/docs/dsl/reference#element-should-be-state)

:::

Notice how the name of the StepDef matches the feature step. This is how step definitions bind to feature steps in Gwen; by name. Notice also that the body calls out to several DSL steps to perform the desired operations. Composing StepDefs in meta is all you need to do to make your features executable.

### StepDefs with parameters

StepDefs can also be declared to accept parameters using one or more `<param-name>` placeholders in the declared name as follows:

:::note Feature Step

```gherkin
  Then the list will contain 2 items
```

:::

:::note StepDef with a parameter

```gherkin {2-3,5}
  @Assertion
  @StepDef
  Scenario: the list will contain <expected-count> items
      Given the displayed count can be located by css ".todo-count strong"
       Then the displayed count should be "$<expected-count>"
```

Calls DSL steps:

- [`<element> can be located by <selector> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl/reference#element-can-be-located-by-selector-expression)
- [`<textRef> should[ not] <match> "<expression>"`](/docs/dsl/reference#text-ref-should-match-expression)

:::

Here the name of the StepDef matches the feature step when the value <code>2</code> (in the feature step) is substituted in place of `<expected-count>` in the StepDef name. This is how parameters are passed to StepDefs in Gwen; by substitution. The last step in the body extracts the parameter value with `$<expected-count>`.

## Meta Load Strategies

### Associative Strategy

When [associative meta](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-associative-meta) is enabled, a meta file is considered to be associated with a feature file if the two files are in the same directory and have the same names excluding file extensions. The associative strategy will, for every feature:
1. Auto discover all the meta files in the path to the feature file and only load those that are either:
    - Not associated with any feature (one or many)
    - Associated with the current feature (one or none)
2. Execute the feature

:::info Coming to Gwen 3

We are planning to enable associative meta by default in the upcomming Gwen 3 release. The current and prior releases use the [default strategy](/docs/meta-specs#default-strategy) by default.

:::

If you have your meta and feature files in a directory structure as follows:

```
/features
 ├── todo.meta
 ├── todo.feature
 ├── /dir1
 │    ├── todo1.meta
 │    ├── todo1.feature
 │    └── todo1a.feature
 └── /dir2
      ├── todo2.meta
      ├── todo2.feature
      └── /dir3
           └── todo3.feature
```

When you launch Gwen to execute on the `features` directory, the associative strategy will:

- Load the `todo.meta` and execute the `todo.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo1.meta` and execute the `todo1.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and execute the `todo1a.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo2.meta` and execute the `todo2.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and execute the `todo3.feature`

When you launch Gwen to execute on the `features/dir1` directory, the associative strategy will:

- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo1.meta` and execute the `todo1.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and execute the `todo1a.feature`

When you launch Gwen to execute the `features/dir2/todo2.feature` file, the associative strategy will:

- Load the `todo.meta` and execute the `todo2.feature`

### External Strategy

The external strategy enables you to manage common and reusable meta files in a separate directory external to you your features. How you name your meta files or how you structure your directory does not matter. This strategy can be used in conjunction with any other meta load strategy.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

To load a single meta file from an external directory, use the `-m/--meta` [CLI option](/docs/cli/launcher#options-and-usage) and specify the path to the meta file:

```shell
./gwen features -m external-meta/common.meta
```

To recursively load all meta files in an external directory:

```shell
./gwen features -m external-meta
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

To load a single meta file from an external directory, use the `-m/--meta` [CLI option](/docs/cli/launcher#options-and-usage) and specify the path to the meta file:

```shell
gwen features -m external-meta\common.meta
```

To recursively load all meta files in an external directory:

```shell
gwen features -m external-meta
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Import Strategy

The import strategy enables you to selectively import one or more meta files for any given feature file so they will load automatically without you having to specify their locations using the `-m/--meta` [CLI option](/docs/cli/launcher#options-and-usage) on every launch. This is useful for cases where you have many reusable meta files and it is not practical to load all of them for every feature file.

:::caution

When using this strategy, it is important to ensure that the meta files you want to import are not located in or under any directories containing your feature files. This is to prevent them from being auto-loaded by the default or associative strategies. Similarly, they should also not reside in any directories containing meta files loaded by the external strategy if you are using that in conjunction with this strategy.

:::

The import strategy can be used to avoid redundant meta loads and improve performance and scalability in extreme cases where all your common meta combined exceeds or approaches 500 KB in size (that is: when you have LOTS of common meta).

For example, say you have your common meta files in one directory and your feature files in another directory as follows:

```
/meta
 ├── module-1.meta
 ├── module-2.meta
 ├── module-3.meta
 │    ..
 ├── module-n.meta
 ├── /dir1
 │    ├── submodule-1.meta
 │    ├── submodule-2.meta
 │    ├── submodule-3.meta
 │    │    ..
 │    └── submodule-n.meta
 │
/features
 ├── spec-1.feature
 ├── spec-2.feature
 ├── spec-3.feature
 │    ..
 └── spec-n.feature
```

To load only one meta file for one feature file using the external meta strategy, you would have to explicitly specify which one using the `-m/--meta` CLI option as follows:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./gwen -m meta/module-1.meta features/spec-1.feature
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```shell
gwen -m meta\module-1.meta features\spec-1.feature
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Having to remember exactly which meta to load for which features is inconvenient and blindly loading all meta files to execute a feature that only requires one or some of them is wasteful.

With [associative meta](/docs/meta-specs#associative-strategy) enabled, you can do away with having to explicitly specify any meta files on CLI calls to Gwen by creating an associative meta file for each feature file and specifying the required meta to import in each.

:::tip Use imports in associative meta

Although it's possible to specify imports directly in feature files, we do not recommend you doing so since it would introduce automation concerns into your features. Confining imports to associative meta instead will keep your features clean and untouched.

:::

For example, you could import the `module-1.meta` into a new (or existing) associative meta file for `spec-1.feature` as follows:

*File: features/spec-1.meta*

```gherkin
  @Import("meta/module-1.meta")
  Feature: Associative spec 1 meta
```

Note that this associative meta specification contains nothing except one import annotation followed by a feature declaration and name. It contains nothing else since it serves only to import one meta file. It would sit alongside your unchanged feature file on the file system as follows:

```
/features
 ├── spec-1.feature
 ├── spec-1.meta
 │    ..
/meta
 ├── module-1.meta
 |   ..
```

With the import in place, you could then invoke Gwen to execute the feature without having to explicitly specify the meta file in the CLI call:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./gwen features/spec-1.feature
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```shell
gwen features\spec-1.feature
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Gwen would then load the associative meta which in turn would load the imported meta before proceeding to execute the feature.

You can add any number of meta imports to a file. The following example imports two meta files for spec 2:

*File: features/spec-2.meta*

```gherkin
  @Import("meta/module-1.meta")
  @Import("meta/module-2.meta")
  Feature: Associative spec 2 meta
```

You can also chain or link imports together. For example, if you wanted `module-2.meta` to load whenever `module-3.meta` is loaded, you could import the former into the latter as follows:

*File: meta/module-3.meta*

```gherkin
  @Import("meta/module-2.meta")
  Feature: meta 3


  @StepDef
  Scenario: ..
      Given ..
       When ..
       Then ..
  ..
```

Now any import of `module-3.meta` will also import `module-2.meta`.

*File: features/spec-3.meta*

```gherkin
  @Import("meta/module-3.meta")
  Feature: Associative spec 3 meta
```

In this example, the `module-2.meta` and `module-3.meta` files will be loaded (in that order) before `test-3.feature` is executed.  Again, this would happen without you having to specify any meta in the CLI call to Gwen.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./gwen features/spec-3.feature
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

```shell
gwen features\spec-3.feature
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The path to the meta file in all imports can be absolute or relative to the directory where Gwen is invoked. If a recursive (or cyclic) import is detected in any import chain, Gwen will report it by throwing an exception with a message identifying the offending import and the file it was declared in.

Meta files loaded through the import strategy get last precedence and therefore can be overridden by meta files loaded through any other meta load strategy.

### Default Strategy

The default strategy will, for every feature:
1. Auto discover and unconditionally load all the meta in the path to the feature
2. Execute the feature

If you have your meta and feature files in a directory structure as follows:

```
/features
 ├── todo.meta
 ├── todo.feature
 ├── /dir1
 │    ├── todo1.meta
 │    ├── todo1.feature
 │    └── todo1a.feature
 └── /dir2
      ├── todo2.meta
      ├── todo2.feature
      └── /dir3
           └── todo3.feature
```

When you launch Gwen to execute on the `features` directory, the default strategy will:

- Load the `todo.meta` and execute the `todo.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo1.meta` and execute the `todo1.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo1.meta` and execute the `todo1a.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo2.meta` and execute the `todo2.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo2.meta` and execute the `todo3.feature`

When you launch Gwen to execute on the `features/dir1` directory, the default strategy will:

- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo1.meta` and execute the `todo1.feature`
- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo1.meta` and execute the `todo1a.feature`

When you launch Gwen to execute the `features/dir2/todo2.feature` file, the default strategy will:

- Load the `todo.meta` and `todo2.meta` and execute the `todo2.feature`

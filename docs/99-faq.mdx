### What is Gwen?

> Gwen = [G]iven [W]hen Th[en]

Gwen is a [Gherkin](https://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/) interpreter with built-in automation capabilities that can readily be utilised for end-to-end testing and robotic processing. Automation is achieved through Gherkin bindings in [meta](/docs/meta) specs, composed with the [Gwen DSL](/docs/dsl) and maintained alongside your feature files. An embedded [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) engine executes scenarios according to the meta you provide to perform [operations](/docs/dsl#actions) in browsers for you.


### What are the key Gwen features?

- Fully [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) compliant interpreter.
- Composable [StepDefs](/docs/meta#stepdefs) and automation details confined to [meta](/docs/meta).
- [Good Gherkin](https://gweninterpreter.wordpress.com/2020/03/09/strictly-good-gherkin-with-gwen/) practice encouraged by default.
- Consistent and reliable execution across [browsers](/docs/settings#gwen-target-browser).
- NPM package for quick [project setup](/docs/get-started) and automatic updates.
- [Parallel](/docs/parallel) and [dry run](/docs/dry-run) execution modes.
- Interactive [REPL](/docs/repl) console and [debugging](/docs/repl#debugging).
- [HTML](/docs/reports/html), [CSV](/docs/reports/csv), [JSON](/docs/reports/json) and [JUnit-XML](/docs/reports/junit-xml) reports.
- Configurable [settings](/docs/settings) and [launch options](/docs/launcher#launch-options).
- Hard, soft, and sustained [assertion modes](/docs/assertions#assertion-modes).
- Multiple web element [locator mechanisms](/docs/dsl#element-locators) including JavaScript
- JavaScript [function bindings](/docs/dsl#js-bindings)
- [System process](/docs/dsl#name-is-defined-by-system-process-expression) calls.
- [CSV and JSON data feeds](/docs/data-feeds).
- [String interpolation](/docs/string-interpolation).
- Runs on Windows, Linux and [Docker](/docs/docker).

### What are the system requirements

- Linux, Mac or Windows OS
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/chrome/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/au/safari/) browser
- [Java 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
  - If you have more than one version of Java installed on your system, you can nominate which one to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
- [node 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (for JS projects)

### Why would I use Gwen over other tools?

- Quickly [get started](/docs/get-started) and be productive with less coding and development.
- Focus more on business process and less on automation concerns.
- Matured over many years in industry.
- Get support from the project maintainers by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/gwen-interpreter).

### How mature is Gwen?

Early adopters helped us mature Gwen in industry since it was open sourced in 2014. We regularly keep the project up to date with the latest Gherkin parser, Selenium library and other dependencies released by the open source community. We strive to maintain consistency, reliability and backwards compatibility at all times to minimise impact to users. We continue to make improvements based on feedback and new ideas. Many years of effort, experience and learnings have helped shape Gwen, making it very reliable and stable.

### Can I add Gwen to my JS project?

Yes, you can add Gwen to JS projects using npm and have all your executable Gherkin living next to your code and integrated into your development and testing process. See the [getting started](/docs/get-started) guide.

### Does Gwen have a GUI interface?
No. You can do everything with the [launcher](/docs/launcher) and your favourite IDE or text editor.

### Can I debug my executable specifications?

Breakpoints can be added to any feature or meta steps by prefixing them with the `@Breakpoint` annotation. See [debugging](/docs/repl#debugging).

### What are the batch and REPL modes?

Batch mode forces Gwen to immediately exit after a given feature or features have executed. You should always invoke Gwen in batch mode on server environments such as build servers.

[REPL mode](/docs/repl) leaves the interpreter session open after a given feature or features have executed, allowing you to interactively enter additional steps to execute or inspect bound data in memory. You should use this mode to verify the execution of your [StepDefs](/docs/meta#stepdefs) as you develop your meta or when you want to diagnose a failing feature.

### What are the available REPL commands?

See [REPL commands](/docs/repl#repl-commands).

### How do I run a single feature file?

[Launch Gwen](/docs/launcher) passing in the single feature file.

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn gwen -b path/to/File.feature
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm run gwen -- -b path/to/File.feature
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm gwen -b path/to/File.feature
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The [`-b`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-batch) launch option instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing (omitting it will open the [REPL](/docs/repl) instead).

### How do I run all features files in a directory?

[Launch Gwen](/docs/launcher) passing in the directory.

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

To run all feature files in the `features` directory, including all feature files in all sub-directories:

```shell
yarn gwen -b features
```

To run all feature files in the `features/todo` directory, including all feature files in all sub-directories:

```shell
yarn gwen -b features/todo
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

To run all feature files in the `features` directory, including all feature files in all sub-directories:

```shell
npm run gwen -- -b features
```

To run all feature files in the `features/todo` directory, including all feature files in all sub-directories:

```shell
npm run gwen -- -b features/todo
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm gwen -b features
```

To run all feature files in the `features/todo` directory, including all feature files in all sub-directories:

```shell
pnpm gwen -b features/todo
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The [`-b`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-batch) launch option instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing (omitting it will open the [REPL](/docs/repl) instead).

### How do I run multiple features in sequence?

To run multiple feature files or directories of features in sequence:

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn gwen -b path/to/file-or-dir-1 path/to/file-or-dir-2 path/to/file-or-dir-N
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm run gwen -- -b path/to/file-or-dir-1 path/to/file-or-dir-2 path/to/file-or-dir-N
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm gwen -b path/to/file-or-dir-1 path/to/file-or-dir-2 path/to/file-or-dir-N
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The [`-b`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-batch) launch option instructs Gwen to exit immediately after executing (omitting it will open the [REPL](/docs/repl) instead).

### How do I run multiple features in parallel?

To run multiple feature files or directories in parallel, specify the [`--parallel`](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-parallel) launch option:

<Tabs
  groupId="jstool"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn gwen --parallel path/to/file-or-dir-1 path/to/file-or-dir-2 path/to/file-or-dir-N
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm run gwen -- --parallel path/to/file-or-dir-1 path/to/file-or-dir-2 path/to/file-or-dir-N
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm gwen --parallel path/to/file-or-dir-1 path/to/file-or-dir-2 path/to/file-or-dir-N
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Can I set a ramp up interval for staggered parallel execution?
Yes. Configure the [`gwen.rampup.interval.seconds`](/docs/settings#gwen-rampup-interval-seconds) setting. If you set this value to 5, the staggered execution will look like this:
```
  time  00   05   10   15   seconds
        │    │    │    │
core 1  │<── feature 1a ──>|<── feature 1b ──> ..
core 2  │    │<── feature 2a ──>|<── feature 2b ──> ..
core 3  │    │    │<── feature 3a ──>|<── feature 3b ──> ..
core 4  │    │    │    │<── feature 4a ──>|<── feature 4b ──> ..
```

### Can I run scenarios in parallel?

Yes, see: [parallel scenario execution](/docs/parallel#parallel-scenario-execution)

### How do I compose step definitions?

By declaring a Scenario and annotating it with the `@StepDef` tag. See [StepDefs and Meta](/docs/meta#stepdefs).

### Can I validate my features?

Yes, see [dry run execution mode](/docs/dry-run).

### Can I ignore (skip over) features and scenarios at execution time?

Yes, you can either:

- Annotate them with the `@Ignore` tag
- Or annotate them with your your own tag like `@MyTag` and launch Gwen with the `-t ~@MyTag` or `--tags ~@MyTag` [launch option](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-tags) to exclude them from execution

### Can I execute certain tagged features and scenarios and exclude all others?

Yes, to execute only those tagged with `@MyTag`, launch Gwen with the `-t @MyTag` or `--tags @MyTag` [launch option](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-tags) to include only those and exclude all others.

### How do I generate evaluation reports?

[HTML evaluation reports](/docs/reports/html) are generated by default. You can specify [-r|--report](/docs/launcher#gwen-launch-options-report) options when launching Gwen to generate other types of reports or change the report output directory.

### Can I generate CSV reports?

### How do I configure logging?

Gwen uses [logback](https://logback.qos.ch/index.html) to perform all logging using the configuration shown below. 
This default configuration is defined in a `log4back.xml` file bundled 
in the Gwen binary. To override this and specify your own configuration, 
add a `logback.configurationFile=file:/path-to-logback-config-file` entry to your [settings](/docs/settings) file in your user home directory. Be sure to use forward slashes instead of backslashes.

```xml
<configuration>
  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%-5level - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>

  <root level="error">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
  </root>
</configuration>
```

Yes, set [`gwen.web.browser.headless`](/docs/settings#gwen-web-browser-headless) to `true`.

### Can I emulate mobile devices in browser?

Yes, see [mobile emulation](/docs/mobile-emulatioin).

### How do I upload files to a file input field?

Define a locator for the file input field and set the path to the file you want upload. Note that you can only use absolute paths. If you wish, you can use system properties or a custom Gwen setting to reference the location of the file.

  ```gherkin
  Given the file input field can be located by xpath "//input[@type='file']"
   
   # using a hard coded path
   When I type "absolute/path/to/file.ex" in the file input field
  
   # or using the system user directory path
   When I type "${user.dir}/file.ext" in the file input field

   # or using a path defined in a custom setting
   When I type "${custom.dir}/file.ext" in the file input field
  ```

### Can I get support?
Support is offered through [sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/gwen-interpreter). By purchasing support you will be sponsoring our open source work on this project.

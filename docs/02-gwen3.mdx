## What's New

### Add Gwen to JS projects and shift testing left

You can now add Gwen to JS projects using npm and have all your executable Gherkin living next to your code and integrated into your development and testing process.

Thanks to [Jacob Juric](https://github.com/Sorixelle) for building [gwen-web-npm](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web-npm).

### `Init` project command

A new [`gwen init`](/docs/cli#init-command) command initialises Gwen in your project directory by creating the following:

- Project, browser, and environment level settings files
- Feature and meta subdirectories
- Sample feature and meta files

### HOCON and JSON settings

Two new settings formats are now supported in addition to properties:

- [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation)
  - A superset of JSON
- JSON
  - Pure JSON format

### Better defaults for better Gherkin

The [`gwen.feature.mode`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-feature-mode) setting now defaults to *declarative* instead of *imperative* to keep DSL steps confined to meta and out of feature specifications.

The [`gwen.behavior.rules`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-behavior-rules) setting now defaults to *strict* instead of *lenient* to enforce correct behavioral semantics and Given-When-Then order in all feature scenarios.

### Pretty logging

Gwen now logs pretty execution results to the console.

#### New CLI option for verbose logging

Use the new `-v|--verbose` CLI option for verbose logging instead (equivalent to Gwen 2 logging).

### Configurable CLI options

CLI options are now configurable enabling you to customize your own Gwen launch profile.

### Selenium 4 integration

The embedded web engine now  uses Selenium 4 and new DSLs have been added to support:

- Relative locators
- Windows and tabs
- Element level screenshots

### What's dropped


- Gwen workspaces have been deprecated in favor of JS projects
- Applitools integration has been removed

### Migration Guide

- [Migrate to Gwen 3](/docs/migration/gwen3)

# Slideshows

Gwen can capture screenshots and generate slideshows in [HTML reports](/docs/reports/html) to create the illusion of video. To get slideshows in your reports, you will need to enable [screenshot capture](/docs/reports/screenshots).

With screenshot capture enabled, each generated HTML feature report will contain links to screenshot attachments next to various steps and a *Slideshow* button in the status header bar at the top.

![Example HTML report](/img/reports/sample-html-slideshow-1.png)

Clicking the *Slideshow* button will open the slideshow in a popup box enabling you to navigate and playback screenshots at different speeds.

Clicking the *Full Screen* link will pull the slideshow out of the popup enabling you to view it in full size.

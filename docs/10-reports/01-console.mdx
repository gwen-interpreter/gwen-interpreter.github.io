# Console Reports

## Pretty logging

> Since Gwen 3

Pretty execution results and statistics are logged to the console in real time (or deferred time in [parallel](/docs/modes/parallel) mode).

![Example pretty log](/img/log/gwen-pretty-log.png)

### Colors

Colors are enabled by default and will be disabled if either:
- the [`gwen.report.console.log.colors`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-report-console-log-colors) setting is `false`
- or the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is `1` or `true`
- or the `CI` environment variable is `1` or `true`

### Logging depth

The default logging depth is 1, meaning that only top level feature steps are logged. This can be overriden with the following setting to log meta steps too:
- [`gwen.report.console.log.depth`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-report-console-log-depth)
  - Default value is `1`
  - Accepts a positive number representing the step depth to log to
    - or `infinity` to log to all depths

## Verbose logging

Invoke Gwen with the [`-v|--verbose`](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-verbose) CLI option to enable verbose (Gwen 2 style) logging and disable pretty logging.

# Video Recordings

Captured video recordings of browser sessions are currently only supported when running Gwen in [Docker with Selenoid](/docs/docker), and if the `gwen.web.capability.videoEnabled` setting is set to `true`. Under these conditions, MP4 video recordings of each session will be attached to feature level [HTML reports](/docs/reports/html) when execution completes.

A button will appear in the report header if one video was captured (one browser session):

![Example video button](/img/reports/sample-html-video-1.png)

A dropdown will appear in the report header if several videos were captured (multiple browser sessions):

![Example video links](/img/reports/sample-html-video-2.png)

Clicking a video button or link in the report will open and play the video in a new browser window.

# Video Recordings

Video recordings of browser sessions can be captured when running Gwen in [Docker with Selenoid](/docs/docker), and if either the [`GWEN_VIDEO`](/docs/cli#environment-variables) environment variable or the `selenoid:options.enableVideo` capability setting are set to `true`. Under these conditions, MP4 video recordings of each session will be attached to [HTML reports](/docs/reports/html) when execution completes.

:::note
Videos can also be captured if you run Gwen on [BrowserStack](/docs/browserstack) or [LambdaTest](/docs/lambdatest) however they are maintained on their dashboards and are not integrated into Gwen HTML reports.
:::

File: *gwen/browsers/selenoid.conf*

```json {5}
gwen {
  web {
    capabilites {
      "selenoid:options" {
        enableVideo = true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution Limitation
Videos will not be recorded when [parallel execution](/docs/modes/parallel), [headless browser](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-web-browser-headless), or interactive (non [--batch/-b](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-batch)) modes are enabled.

### Summary reports

A button will appear in the report summary line for each feature in the summary report (one browser session):

![Example video button](/img/reports/sample-html-video-0.png)

### Detail reports

A button will appear in the detail report header if one video was captured (one browser session):

![Example video button](/img/reports/sample-html-video-1.png)

A dropdown will appear in the report header if several videos were captured (multiple browser sessions):

![Example video links](/img/reports/sample-html-video-2.png)

Clicking a video button or link in the report will open and play the video in a new browser window.

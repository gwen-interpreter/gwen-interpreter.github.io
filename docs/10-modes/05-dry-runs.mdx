# Dry Runs

> Since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

## Catch syntax and binding errors

Dry runs can be performed on features to verify that they are syntactically correct and that all references have bindings that will resolve at runtime. This allows you to quickly validate features and catch potential errors before committing them to an execution cycle. The [`-n|--dry-run`](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-dry-run) CLI option is used to launch Gwen in this mode.

The primary purpose of dry runs is to perform static validation of all syntax, bindings and [StepDefs](/docs/meta#stepdefs) throughout your feature and [meta](/docs/meta) files. In a dry run:
- Browsers sessions are never started
- Web pages are never loaded (and web elements can therefore cannot be accessed)
- Non static bindings are never evaluated
- JavaScript is never evaluated
- System processes are never evaluated
- Databases are never accessed

Results will be logged to the console and in [HTML reports](/docs/reports/html) that you can inspect to find discovered issues.

#### Example 

If you leave out or forget to define a selector for an input field, it would be detected by a dry run and reported in the HTML report as follows:

## DryRun Annotations

> Since [v3.55.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.55.0)

`@DryRun` annotations can be used on any step to assign a value (or values) to any reference in a dry run, and are very useful when: 
- A reference to a binding cannot be evaluated and causes failures that otherwise would not occur outside of a dry run
- You want to exercise all step definitions and combinations of parameters to step definitions
- You want to exercise an abstraction over a fixed set of inputs

:::info
DryRun annotations are only honoured in dry run evaluations and are completely ignored otherwise!
:::

#### Example 

Consider a [meta](/docs/meta) file with the following step definitions:

```gherkin
  @StepDef
  Scenario: I perform step 1
    When I do this thing

  @StepDef
  Scenario: I perform step 2
    When I do that thing
```

Consider the following scenario where you might want to call the 1st or 2nd step definition depending on the value contained in some number displayed on a web page.

```gherkin {3}
  Given number can be located by css "span.number"
   When I navigate to "https://example.com"
    And I perform step ${number}
   Then ..
```

This would work perfectly fine when `${number}` evaluates to 1 or 2 in a web page loaded in a browser. However during a dry run, browsers sessions are never started, web pages are never loaded and looking up web elements and fetching their values is not possible. Therefore the 3rd step above would fail since the number in the web element is nowhere to be accessed. In this instance, the standard Gwen behavior is to return a dry run placeholder value of `$[dryValue:webElementText]`. That step on the 3rd line would resolve to the following:

```gherkin
  And I perform step $[dryValue:webElementText]
```

This would result in an undefined step error being reported since it cannot be matched to any step definition in our meta.

#### A non-ideal workaround

Before `@DryRun` annotations were introduced, one way to work around this problem involved introducing predicates and using those as guards on calls to each step definition explicitly as follows:

``` gherkin {2-3,5-6}
  Given number can be located by css "span.number"
    And number 1 is defined by js "${number} == 1"
    And number 2 is defined by js "${number} == 2"
   When I navigate to "https://example.com"
    And I perform step 1 if number 1
    And I perform step 2 if number 2
   Then ..
```

This effectively works since Gwen always resolves predicates to `true` values in dry runs. However, this is not ideal because it forces you to break your abstraction and introduces unwanted redundancies. This is the primary reason why `@DryRun` annotations were introduced; to avoid this kind of workaround.

:::tip 
Use DryRun annotations to manage dry run values and preserve your abstractions.

### Single Values

> Annotation synax: `@DryRun(name='<name>',value='<value>')`

The solution is to provide a dry run value for the `number` reference in the step using the `@DryRun` annotation as follows:

```gherkin {3}
  Given number can be located by css "span.number"
   When I navigate to "https://example.com"
    And I perform step ${number}    @DryRun(name='number',value='1')
   Then ..
```

Now when you do a dry run on this, the `${number}` reference will take on the value `1` and resolve to the following step:

```gherkin
  And I perform step 1
```

This would result in a successful call to the 1st step definition. So it will be exercised.

### Multiple Values

> Annotation synax: `@DryRun(name='<name>',value={'<value-1>','<value-2>','<value-N>'})`

What if we wanted to exercise both step definitions 1 and 2 in the meta? The solution is to provide multiple dry run values for `number` on the calling step using the `@DryRun` annotation as follows:

```gherkin {3} showLineNumbers
  Given number can be located by css "span.number"
   When I navigate to "https://example.com"
    And I perform step ${number}    @DryRun(name='number',value={'1','2'})
   Then ..
```

Now when you perform a dry run on this, the `${number}` reference will take on the value `1` followed by `2` and the step on line 3 above will be expanded in-place into the following two steps:

```gherkin
  And I perform step 1
  And I perform step 2
```

This will result in a successful call to both the 1st and 2nd step definitions. So now both will be exercised.

### Delimited Values

> Annotation synax: `@DryRun(name='<name>',value='<value-1> <value-2> <value-N>')` (space delimited example)

Similarly, you can also assign a dry run value to any binding that cannot be evaluated during a dry run such as a JavaScript binding, for example.

Consider the following where you want to source a space delmited list of values from a script and loop over each value, making each one available to a step definition.

``` gherkin {11,14-15} showLineNumbers
  @StepDef
  Scenario: I perform step one
    When I do this thing
    
  @StepDef
  Scenario: I perform step two
    When I do that thing

  @StepDef
  Scenario: I perform step
    Given I perform step ${name}

  Scenario: Process each value
    Given names is defined by js "$('.name').toArray().join(' ')"
     When I perform step for each name in names delimited by " "
     Then ..
```

The highlighted step on line 11 would fail in a dry run scenario, resulting in an undefined step error because it would have resolved to the following:

``` gherkin
   Given I perform step $[dryValue:javascript]
```

In this instance, Gwen has substituted the `$[dryValue:javascript]` placeholder value for the `names` binding on line 14 which binds to a JavaScript expression that cannot be evaluated during a dry run. This placeholder value is then used in the `for each` loop on line 15, and since it has no spaces in it, the entire value itself becomes the sole loop value.

The solution is to assign a dry run value to the JavaScript binding as follows:

``` gherkin {2}
  Scenario: Process each value
    Given names is defined by js "$('.name').toArray().join(' ')"    @DryRun(name='names',value='one two')
     When I perform step for each name in names delimited by " "
     Then ..
```

Note: If you're using the [DocString](/docs/advanced/doc-strings) synax, you can do it like this:

``` gherkin {2-5}
  Scenario: Process each value
    Given names is defined by js    @DryRun(name='names',value='one two')
          """
          $('.name').toArray().join(' ')
          """
     When I perform step for each name in names delimited by " "
     Then ..
```

Now when you perform a dry run, the `names` reference will take on the value `one two` and both our step definitions will be called in the for-each the loop:

```gherkin
  Given I perform step one
  Given I perform step two
```

This will result in a successful call to both step definitions. So both will be exercised.

:::note
You also also source values from settings in annoations using the `${setting.name}` syntax in the `value` attribute.

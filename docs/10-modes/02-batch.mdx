# Batch

> Since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

Batch mode forces Gwen to immediately exit after a given feature or features have executed. You should always invoke Gwen in batch mode on server environments such as build servers.

To execute Gwen in batch mode, simply specify the [`-b|--batch`](/docs/cli#gwen-cli-options-batch) command line switch. Omitting it will open the [REPL](/docs/cli/repl) otherwise.

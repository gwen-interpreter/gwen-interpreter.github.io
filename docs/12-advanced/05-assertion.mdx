# Assertion Modes

> Since [v2.30.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.30.0)

## Hard, Soft, and Sustained Assertions

Assertion modes only apply to steps that perform actual assertions.

### Hard assertions (default)

With hard assertions, the first assertion error to be detected will be reported as a failure and execution will halt.

> Since [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0), the `@Hard` annotation can be used on any assertion step to make it fail hard.

```gherkin
  Then @Hard the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

### Soft assertions

With soft assertions, every assertion error that is detected is collected and reported as a failure without halting execution.

> Since [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0), the `@Soft` annotation can be used on any assertion step to make it fail soft.

```gherkin
  Then @Soft the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

### Sustained assertions

With sustained assertions, every assertion error that is detected is collected and reported as a sustained error without halting execution or raising failure.

> Since [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0), the `@Sustained` annotation can be used on any assertion step to make it sustained.

```gherkin
  Then @Sustained the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

## Default assertion mode

Hard, soft, or sustained assertions can be configured as the default through the following setting:

- [`gwen.assertion.mode`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-assertion-mode)
  - This setting controls whether or not hard, soft or sustained assertions are enabled by default. Valid values include:
    - `hard` to halt execution on first assertion error and report failure (default)
    - `soft` to collect all assertion errors and continue execution whilst reporting them as failures
    - `sustained` to collect all assertion errors and continue execution without reporting them as failures

## Step Level Annotations
The `@Hard`, `@Soft` and `@Sustained` annotations introduced in [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0) can be used on individiual steps to override the default assertion mode setting.

For example, if the [`gwen.assertion.mode`](/docs/settings/reference#gwen-assertion-mode) setting is set to `hard`, the following would perform a hard assertion since no overriding annotation is specified.

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

The following would also perform a hard assertion since the `@Hard` annotatation is explicitly specified (although redundant).

```gherkin
  Then @Hard the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

The following however, would perform a soft assertion since the `@Soft` annotatation is specified.

```gherkin
  Then @Soft the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

Similarly, the following would perform a sustained assertion since the `@Sustained` annotatation is specified.

```gherkin
  Then @Sustained the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

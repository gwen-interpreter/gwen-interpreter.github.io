# Named Browser Sessions

> Since [v1.2.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

## Driving Multiple Browsers

This feature adds support for driving multiple browser sessions in a feature.  Each session is identified by a given name.

For example, the following starts two browser sessions named Gwen and Gwen-web, switches between them, and performs operations in each.

```gherkin
  Given I start a browser for Gwen
    And I start a browser for Gwen-web

  # Switch to the Gwen browser and navigate to a URL
  Given I switch to Gwen
   When I navigate to "https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen"
   Then the page title should start with "gwen-interpreter/gwen:"

  # Switch to the Gwen-web session and navigate to a URL
  Given I switch to Gwen-web
   When I navigate to "https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web"
   Then the page title should start with "gwen-interpreter/gwen-web:"
```

Any number of sessions can be created in a feature. You can switch between sessions at any time.  When the feature exits, then all browser sessions also exit.

If you want to explicitly close a session, you can do it like this:

```gherkin
  # close the Gwen session
  Given I close the browser for Gwen
```

All bound data in the environment context is shared between sessions.

# Assertions

> Since [v2.30.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v2.30.0)

## Assertion Modes

Assertion modes only apply to steps that perform [assertions](/docs/dsl#assertions).

### Hard assertions (default)

With hard assertions, the first assertion error to be detected will be reported as a failure and execution will halt.

> Since [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0), the `@Hard` annotation can be used on any assertion step to make it fail hard.

```gherkin
  Then @Hard the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

### Soft assertions

With soft assertions, every assertion error that is detected is collected and reported as a failure without halting execution.

> Since [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0), the `@Soft` annotation can be used on any assertion step to make it fail soft.

```gherkin
  Then @Soft the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

### Sustained assertions

With sustained assertions, every assertion error that is detected is collected and reported as a sustained error without halting execution or raising failure.

> Since [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0), the `@Sustained` annotation can be used on any assertion step to make it sustained.

```gherkin
  Then @Sustained the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

### Default mode

Hard, soft, or sustained assertions can be configured as the default through the following setting:

- [`gwen.assertion.mode`](/docs/settings#gwen-assertion-mode)
  - This setting controls whether or not hard, soft or sustained assertions are enabled by default. Valid values include:
    - `hard` to halt execution on first assertion error and report failure (default)
    - `soft` to collect all assertion errors and continue execution whilst reporting them as failures
    - `sustained` to collect all assertion errors and continue execution without reporting them as failures

### Mode annotations
The `@Hard`, `@Soft` and `@Sustained` annotations introduced in [v3.43.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.43.0) can be used on individiual steps to override the default assertion mode setting.

For example, if the [`gwen.assertion.mode`](/docs/settings#gwen-assertion-mode) setting is set to `hard`, the following would perform a hard assertion since no overriding annotation is specified.

```gherkin
  Then the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

The following would also perform a hard assertion since the `@Hard` annotatation is explicitly specified (although redundant).

```gherkin
  Then @Hard the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

The following however, would perform a soft assertion since the `@Soft` annotatation is specified.

```gherkin
  Then @Soft the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

Similarly, the following would perform a sustained assertion since the `@Sustained` annotatation is specified.

```gherkin
  Then @Sustained the page title should contain "xGwen automation"
```

## Message Annotation

> Since [v3.29.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.29.0)

`@Message` annotations can be used to override default error messages reported by failed assertions with custom messages to provide better meaning and context.

#### Example

Consider the following which checks that a form error should not be displayed on a page.

```gherkin {2}
  Given form error can be located by css `.form-error`
   Then form error should not be displayed
```    

The assertion on line 2 will fail and report the following message if the error is displayed:
- `assertion failed: form error should not be displayed`

The default message suggests that an error was displayed but it does not explain what the error was. To override this and provide a more informative message, add a `@Message` annotation to the assertion as follows:

```gherkin {2}
  Given form error can be located by css `.form-error`
   Then form error should not be displayed    @Message("Form error was: ${form error}")
```

This will now output a more meaninful error and include the contents of the form error in it too.
- Example: `Form error was: Please provide all mandatory fields`

## Cumulative Assertions

> Since [v3.61.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v3.61.0)

Error messages raised by a series [soft](#soft-assertions) or [sustained](#sustained-assertions) assertions can be aggregated into a single error with a [cumulative assert](/docs/dsl#cumulative-asserts).

### Usage

  ```gherkin {4} showLineNumbers
    Then @Soft x should not be blank
     And @Soft y should be "1"
     And @Soft z should be true
     And there should be no accumulated errors
  ```

  Line 4 will pass if all the preceeding assertions pass. If however, the assertions on line 1 and 3 fail (and the one on line 2 passes), then it will raise an assertion error containing the two failed messages as follows:

  ```
  2 errors:
  (1) x should not be blank
  (2) z should be true but got false
  ```

  ### Resetting

  You can also [reset accumulated errors](/docs/dsl#i-reset-accumulated-errors) if you need to start a new series of asserts. All currently accumulated errors will be cleared.

  ```gherkin
    And I reset accumulated errors
  ```

### Implicit variables

#### Text Form

  Accumulated error messages can also be referenced through the implicit [`gwen.accumulated.errors`](/docs/implicit-values#gwen-accumulated-errors) variable.

  ```gherkin {4} showLineNumbers
    Then @Soft x should not be blank
     And @Soft y should be "1"
     And @Soft z should be true
     And errors is "${gwen.accumulated.errors}"
  ```

  If the assertions on line 1 and 3 fail, `errors` on line 4 will contain:

  ```
  2 errors:
  (1) x should not be blank
  (2) z should be true but got false
  ```

  #### JSON Form

  You can also reference the accumulated error messages as a JSON array through the implicit [`gwen.accumulated.errors:JSONArray`](/docs/implicit-values#gwen-accumulated-errors-json-array) variable.  This approach is very flexible as it allows you to customise.

  ```gherkin {4} showLineNumbers
    Then @Soft x should not be blank
     And @Soft y should be "1"
     And @Soft z should be true
     And errors is defined by js
         """
         () => {
           const errorsJson = ${gwen.accumulated.errors:JSONArray}
           return `${errorsJson.length} error(s) = ${errorsJson.join(', ')}`
         }
         """
  ```

  If the assertions on line 1 and 3 fail, `gwen.accumulated.errors:JSONArray` will resolve to:

  ```json
  ["x should not be blank","z should be true but got false"]
  ```

  And `errors` will evaluate to:

  ```
  2 error(s) = x should not be blank, z should be true but got false
  ```

  You could also use it to get the number of errors as follows:

  ```gherkin
     And error count is defined by js "${gwen.accumulated.errors:JSONArray}.length"
  ```

  This `error count` expression would evaluate to 2 in this example.

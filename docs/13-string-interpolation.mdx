# String Interpolation

> Since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

It is often useful to reference settings, captured values and other text throughout your feature and meta files. To support this, Gwen provides a placholder substitution mechanism.

### Placeholder Syntax

Placeholders are declared using the `${placholder}` syntax and can include:

- An environment variable name (since gwen-web 2.36.0)
  - example: `${env.USER}` for the `USER` variable
- A system property name
- A [Gwen setting](/docs/settings) name
- A named binding in the currently accessible scope
- [JS arrow functions](/docs/js-functions#inlined-functions)
 
## Examples

Substitution involves replacing named placeholders with their values.

```gherkin
 Feature: String Interpolation

Scenario: By Substitution
    
    Given my mechanism is "substitution"
      And my value is "${my.property}"
      And my proposition is "By ${my mechanism}, my value will be ${my value}"
     Then my proposition should be "By substitution, my value will be ${my.property}"
```

# About the Logo

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/gwen-attractor-trans.svg')} width="30%"/>

The Gwen logo is a [Lorenz attractor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) that looks like 
a butterfly.

```gherkin
Feature: Deterministic Chaos
    
  Scenario: The Butterfly Effect
    Given a deterministic and nonlinear system
     When a small change is initially applied
     Then a large change will eventually result
```

The smallest of changes to programs and inputs can give rise to the most erratic effects. Gwen evaluates software systems and automates robotic processes by:

- Creating conditions (*Givens*)
- Performing actions (*Whens*)
- Asserting expectations (*Thens*)

The cumulative result is a chain of instructions that execute to model cause and effect and verify all outcomes. The proposition being that Gwen can detect chaotic behavior.

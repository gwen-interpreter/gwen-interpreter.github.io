# About the Logo

The Gwen logo is a [Lorenz attractor](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor) that looks like a butterfly.

```gherkin
  Feature: Deterministic chaos
    
  Scenario: The butterfly effect
      Given a deterministic and nonlinear system
       When a small change is initially applied
       Then a large change will eventually result
```

Software systems can be observed to possess chaotic behavior. The smallest of changes to programs and environments can give rise to the most erratic effects. Gwen evaluates software by:

- Creating conditions (*Givens*)
- Performing actions (*Whens*)
- Asserting expectations (*Thens*)

The cumulative result is a chain of instructions that execute in sequence to model cause and effect. The proposition is that Gwen can detect chaos.
